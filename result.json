      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Sid Meier's Civilization II is a PC turn based strategy game released in 1996. The game was met with critical and commercial success and is considered by many publications (such as IGN) to be one of the greatest games of all time. The object of the game is to create a civilization that can stand the test of time. Expand, conquer, trade and spread your culture around the world with the ultimate goal of either conquering all other nations or being the first nation to colonize another world.</p><p>Although the title bears his name, Sid Meier actually had little to do with creating Civilization II. The game was designed by Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs and Douglas Caspian-Kaufman.</p><h2><span>Gameplay</span></h2><p>Civilization II is a turn based strategy game. Each game starts off on a randomly generated map in the year 4,000 B.C. The player is given one settler unit which can be used to build cities. Cities in turn can be used to bolster scientific development, generate tax income, and produce units such as more settlers, military units, and trade units. The game puts over 50 military units at a players disposal. Once a player has moved all of his / her units, the players turn ends, time progresses and other nations take their turns.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389614\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67770034843206\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389614\"><img alt=\"Making a civilization.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg 1148w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14035/389614-civ2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Making a civilization.</figcaption></figure><p>As a game of Civilization II progresses, the player will discover more and more technologies, build more and more cities as well as explore more of the map. As a player explores more of the map, he or she will encounterbarbarians as well as other Civilizations vying for dominance in the world. An interesting aspect about the Civilization series is that a player can choose to play the game peacefully, one does not need to be a warmonger in order to be successful. Players can sign cease fires, peace treaties, alliances and share technology / military units with other nations. If a player is being particularly aggressive, his reputation will take a hit and other nations will react accordingly.</p><h3>Governments</h3><p>There are seven government types a player can choose from, with each government offering numerous advantages / disadvantages. Much of the following is taken from the ingame Civiliopedia:</p><p><u><em><strong>Despotism</strong></em></u>: A despotism is a government in which the ruler has absolute power, usually enforced by the military. In Civilization II, Despotism is the default government, it is usually best to change government types to Monarchy as soon as possible.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389618\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67708333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-389618\"><img alt=\"Overview of the city.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg 1152w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14035/389618-civ2b.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Overview of the city.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Each unit above the city size costs one Shield per turn.</li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.</li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.</li><li>Despotism has a high rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.</li><li>Under a Despotism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 60%.</li><li>Any terrain square that ordinarily produces three or more of any resource (Food, Shields, or Trade) produces one less.</li><li>Because of Despotism's high rate of corruption, it is almost always an inferior form of government. Try to switch to a Monarchy as soon as possible.</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Monarchy</strong></em></u>: A Monarchy is a government ruled by a King or Queen. In Civilization II, a Monarchy is a good government to have for a small, new civilization.</p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.</li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.</li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.</li><li>Monarchy has a moderate rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.</li><li>Under a Monarchy, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 70%.</li><li>Monarchy is an excellent form of government for a young civilization.</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Fundamentalism</strong></em></u>: Fundamentalism is a form of government centered around a certain set of beliefs, usually religious. In real life, this would be akin to a theocracy. In Civilization II, Fundamentalism is a good government to have if one goes on the war path.</p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the tenth unit costs one Shield per turn (except Fanatics, which never require maintenance).</li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.</li><li>Under Fundamentalism, no citizen is ever unhappy.</li><li>Fundamentalism has a very low rate of corruption.</li><li>Under Fundamentalism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.</li><li>Under Fundamentalism, all Science production is HALVED.</li><li>Improvements that normally convert unhappy citizens to content citizens produce \"tithes\" (money) equivalent to the number of people they would normally convert, and require no maintenance.</li><li>The diplomatic penalties for terrorist acts committed by Diplomats and Spies is reduced.</li><li>Fundamentalism eliminates all happiness problems and provides excellent revenue, although research tends to languish.</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Republic</strong></em></u>: A Republic is an assembly of autonomous city-states under the control of a central government. Although the central government has the ultimate say in matters that affect the society as a whole, the city-states are given a certain amount of latitude in the governing of local affairs. In Civilization II, a Republic is a good government for scientific advancement and is usually a good fit for a medium sized empire to have.</p><ol><li>Each unit costs one shield per turn.</li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.</li><li>Each unit beyond the first unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.</li><li>Republics experience a low rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.</li><li>Under a Republic, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.</li><li>Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.</li><li>Switching to a Republic can give an astounding boost to your Science and Luxury revenues, although you will probably be forced to shift some Trade to Luxuries in order to prevent unhappiness.</li><li>Republics make it difficult and expensive to keep a sizable army in the field, but building certain Improvements and Wonders can help to alleviate this problem.</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Communism</strong></em></u>: In a true Communist system, all property is owned collectively by the people, and labor is organized to be equally advantageous to all people. In Civilization II, Communism is a good government to have a nation on the warpath.</p><ol><li>Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.</li><li>Settlers eat one Food per turn.</li><li>Up to three military units in each city institute \"martial law\". Each of these units makes two unhappy citizens content.</li><li>Under Communism, state control of the economy eliminates organized crime. Your cities, therefore, experience no corruption.</li><li>All Spy units produced under Communist governments are Veterans.</li><li>Under Communism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.</li><li>Communism is best for large, far-flung empires that need to maintain a large military.</li><li>Use your powerful Spies to steal technology from the capitalist pigs!</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Democracy</strong></em></u>: A Democracy is ruled by a president elected by the people. In Civilization II, Democracies are great for peaceful empires who wish to pursue research and generate money.</p><ol><li>Each unit costs one shield per turn.</li><li>Settlers eat two Food per turn.</li><li>Each unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes two citizens in its home city to become unhappy.</li><li>Democracies experience no corruption or waste.</li><li>Tax/Luxury/Science rates can be set to any level desired.</li><li>Under a Democracy, each square that ordinarily produces at least one unit of Trade produces an extra unit of Trade.</li><li>The units and cities of a Democracy are immune to bribery in any form.</li><li>Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.</li><li>Democracies can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and scientific research. However, because of the severe happiness restrictions on military units, this form of government tends to be viable only for large, advanced civilizations.</li><li>Increasing your Luxury rate and building Improvements and Wonders can help alleviate unhappiness.</li></ol><p><u><em><strong>Anarchy:</strong></em></u> Anarchy is a lack of government, and occurs in Civilization II when a nation is switching from one government type to another. Under Anarchy, many cities become unhappy and no money or scientific research is generated.</p><p>Civilization II also features live action actors that serve as a council of advisers. The council will comment on how you're doing and fight with one another on what matters are more important for your empire.</p><h3><u><span>Playable civilizations and their color</span></u></h3><p>There are 21 playable Civilizations in Civ 2. The following is a list of playable Civilizations and their ingame color</p><p>White: Romans, Russian, Celts.</p><p>Green: Babylonians, Zulus, Japanese.</p><p>Blue: Germans, French, Vikings.</p><p>Yellow: Egyptians, Aztecs, Spanish.</p><p>Teal: Americans, Chinese, Persians.</p><p>Orange: Greeks, English, Carthaginians.</p><p>Purple: Indians, Mongols, Sioux.</p><p>Red: Barbarians.</p><p>Civilizations who are the same color cannot appear together in the same game. For example, the Romans and Russians cannot appear together because both are the color white. A little known fact is that the color of your civilization determines in what order your starting location is picked as well as how much you are handicapped in scientific research. The white civilization gets their starting location picked first, the green second, so and and so forth. Because the purple civilization has its location is picked last, every civilizations scientific advancement is either helped or hindered depending on how many more or less technologies one has when compared to the purple Civilization. For example, if the Romans have 10 more technologies when compared to the Indians, the Romans will research at a slower pace then they would normally. The purple civilization will always research at a normal rate. This is why if one plans on being a technologically advanced nation, it is best to pick one of the purple Civilizations.</p><h2>Community</h2><p>The Civilization series has a strong online community. Players have come up with a number of ways to keep the game interesting, such as succession games (one player plays for a set number of turns, passes it onto someone else to play for a set number of turns, etc.), GOTM (game of the month; One of the big fansites creates a scenario every month for people to play, allowing players to directly compete and compare their results to one another). While the focus of this community tends to shift towards the newer releases in the franchise, particuaraly Civilization IV, there is still an active GOTM for Civilization II. There is also a large number of guides and strategies to be found on community fansites, as well as mods and scenarios.</p><p>The two main fansites for all things Civilization:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.civfanatics.com\" rel=\"nofollow \">www.civfanatics.com</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.apolyton.com\" rel=\"nofollow \">www.apolyton.com</a></p><h2>Expansion Packs and special editions</h2><p>There were two expansion packs released for Civ II. The first expansion pack, Conflicts, came with 20 new scenarios, 12 created by makers of the game and 8 by fans. The second expansion pack, Fantastic Worlds, came with 19 new scenarios as well as a variety of editors for the game.</p><p>In addition to expansion packs, there were three versions of Civilization II released. Civilization II, Civilization II: Gold Edition and Civilization II: Test of Time.</p><p>Civilization II: Gold Edition is a slightly updated version of Civilization II. The game features multiplayer and includes both expansion packs. Civ II: Gold Edition also features slight tweaks to gameplay, of note being an extremely hostile AI when compared to that of the original version. Many believe that this makes the game more challenging, but much less enjoyable than its predecessor as it is nearly impossible to maintain any type of peaceful relations with the AI.</p><p>Civilization II: Test of Time contains the original Civilization but with different graphics. It also contains a modified fantasy version of the game.</p><h2>Console Releases</h2><p>Civilization II was released on the Playstation console towards the end of 1998. While the core gameplay remains intact, there is no option to utilize the playstation mouse and the low resolution has led to some users complaining about the text being hard to read. To compensate, the entire user interface was rebuilt, though Gamespot reviewer Vince Broady criticized the redesigned menus as seeming, \"thrown together\". Additionally, the game speed was reduced from that of the PC version, with AI turns take multiple minutes to complete.</p><p>In 2006, Gryphondale Studios ported the game to the N-Gage platform as \"Civilization\". The user interface was again entirely redesigned, this time making extensive use of shortcuts via the phone's keys. The core game, graphics and sounds remained essentially unchanged, but the videos for the various wonders and instances of ingame music were removed to conserve space.</p>",

In this world, there are two primary races; the <a href=\"/beorc/3015-1089/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1089\">beorc</a>, or humans, and <a href=\"/laguz/3015-381/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-381\">laguz</a>, or humanoids with animal traits capable of transforming into animals. The game focuses on <a href=\"/ike/3005-1428/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1428\">Ike</a>, the beorc son of <a href=\"/greil/3005-3005/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3005\">Greil</a>, a mercenary and leader of the <a href=\"/greil-mercenaries/3015-4109/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4109\">Greil Mercenaries</a>; a company that operates within the beorc nation of <a href=\"/crimea/3035-654/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-654\">Crimea</a>.</p><p>Shortly after Ike has been inducted as a full member of the mercenary company, they receive bad news. <a href=\"/daein/3035-656/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-656\">Daein</a>, a neighboring beorc nation led by <a href=\"/ashnard/3005-3007/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3007\">King Ashnard</a>, has invaded Crimea. When members of the company are sent out to learn more, they stumble across <a href=\"/elincia/3005-2299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2299\">Princess Elincia</a>, who as it turns out is the lone surviving member of the Crimean royal family. With the forces of Daein closing in, Greil makes the decision to abandon the mercenary fort and mobilize everyone, including Ike and <a href=\"/mist/3005-2767/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2767\">Mist</a>, Ike's younger sister, in order to escort Elincia to safety within the borders of the laguz nation of <a href=\"/gallia/3035-657/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-657\">Gallia</a>.</p><p>On the way, as the mercenaries stop to rest for the night, Greil encounters the <a href=\"/the-black-knight/3005-3008/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3008\">Black Knight</a>, one of Daein's most powerful generals and an apparent former pupil Greil's. Ike arrives on the scene just in time to watch as Greil and the Black Knight fight each other, but Greil, who refuses to wield the sword the Black Knight grants him, is slain. The Black Knight then leaves, with Ike unable to do anything but bring his dying father back to the camp.</p><p>Following Greil's death, Ike inherits command of the Greil Mercenaries despite his youth and inexperience. He takes Elincia to Gallia as promised, but rather than remain in hiding, they instead decide to travel to <a href=\"/begnion/3035-655/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-655\">Begnion</a>, the largest beorc nation on Tellius and to which Crimea was once part of, in the hopes that they might help drive Daein from Crimea's borders.</p><p>Thus begins a long journey, as Ike leads the mercenaries back up through Crimea, where with the help of some laguz they are able to arrange for a ship captained by <a href=\"/nasir/3005-3004/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3004\">Nasir</a> to take them around the continent to Begnion. While out at sea, they stop a group of pirates (in actuality, Daein soldiers in disguise being assisted by the crow laguz of <a href=\"/kilvas/3035-660/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-660\">Kilvas</a>) from boarding a Begnion vessel, which to their luck happens to be carrying <a href=\"/sanaki/3005-3025/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3025\">Apostle Sanaki</a>, the leader of the Begnion Empire.</p><p>Sanaki agrees to help Ike and Elincia in their request, in return for some aid of their own. She needs help in exposing a laguz <a href=\"/slavery/3015-1779/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1779\">slavery</a> ring that's still operating within circles of the Begnion senate. At around the same time, <a href=\"/reyson/3005-3002/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3002\">Reyson</a>, the heron laguz prince of Serenes, a forest kingdom that was destroyed twenty years prior in a fit of rage by the people of Begnion, is tricked by <a href=\"/naesala/3005-3001/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3001\">Naesala</a>, the ruler of Kilvas, into becoming the slave of <a href=\"/oliver/3005-3024/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3024\">Duke Oliver Tanas</a>, a Begnion senator.</p><p>Ike takes the mercenaries out to Oliver's estate, where they discover Reyson being held captive. Caught red-handed, Oliver flees into the ruins of Serenes, and the mercenaries give chase. Within the forest, they encounter <a href=\"/leanne/3005-3022/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3022\">Leanne</a>, a heron laguz princess and Reyson's long-lost sister, who had slept in the forest ever since the night of the Serenes Massacre. Together, Ike's forces and the laguz fend off Oliver's attempt to capture Leanne for his own. Following this, Reyson and Leanne use the power of a heron galdr, or magical song, to restore life to the forest; Ike and Mist immediately recognize the melody as the lullaby their mother used to sing to them when they were children.</p><p>For outing the existence of the laguz slavery, Ike is granted a lordship in order to officially lead the now Begnion-backed army intent on freeing Crimea. To get there, however, they must pass through Daein. Along the way, Nasir steals an old bronze medallion that belonged to Mist.</p><p>In Daein, Ike and Mist learn several truths that startle them. Their parents, Greil and <a href=\"/elena/3005-3006/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3006\">Elena</a>, were in fact originally from Daein. Further, Greil's real identity was that of General Gawain, one of Daein's Four Riders; the elite generals of the Daein military. Following the Serenes Massacre, the Daein forces had captured another member of the royal Serenes house. Ashnard desired the medallion, known as <a href=\"/lehrans-medallion/3055-774/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-774\">Lehran's Medallion</a>, and kept the heron princess hostage so that she would reveal the secret to releasing the dark god confined within.</p><p>Ike and Mist's mother, Elena, served as a priestess at the temple in which the princess was being held. After befriending the laguz, Elena was granted possession of the medallion; she was also taught the melody of the Song of Release to go along with it. Elena then fled with Gawain to Gallia, where Gawain changed his name. The two settled down, and Elena gave birth to Ike and Mist.</p><p>However, this peace was broken several years later. On a day when Greil took hold of the medallion, he lost his mind and went on a killing spree. He was only stopped when Elena stepped in front of her husband and allowed herself to be impaled by his sword so that she could take the medallion away. When Greil returned to his senses and saw what he had done, he damaged the tendons in his sword arm so that he would never be able to wield such a weapon again. When it was discovered that Mist had the internal spiritual balance required to hold the medallion safely, as Elena had, Greil forbade everyone but her from holding it. He then took his family north to Crimea, where he founded the Greil Mercenaries.</p><p>With the truth fully known, Ike leads the army back into Crimea, where they confront Ashnard in the capital of Melior. With his defeat, Ashnard is killed, and the medallion is returned to the herons for safekeeping. It is also revealed that the reason Nasir stole the medallion was to help his granddaughter <a href=\"/ena/3005-3003/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3003\">Ena</a>, who had joined the Daein forces to remain close to her lover, <a href=\"/rajaion/3005-3023/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3023\">Rajaion</a>; a dragon laguz that had been twisted through Daein experimentation into a feral monster and Ashnard's personal mount.</p><p>With the conflict over, Elincia ascends to her rightful place as the new queen of Crimea, and the beorc and laguz work together to restore the nation to its former glory.</p><h3>Themes</h3><p>One of the most prominent themes of Path of Radiance's storyline is that of <a href=\"/racism/3015-2236/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2236\">racism</a>. The relationship between beorc and laguz has several layers of complexity. For example, the royal family of Crimea is allied with the laguz royalty of Gallia, but the peasantry of both nations are largely distrustful of each other. The people of Daein are raised in their schools to believe that laguz are vile and should be killed, while the dragon nation of Goldoa, on the other hand, maintains a strict policy of isolationism and under normal circumstances refuses to allow anyone that is not of their kind within their nation's borders.</p><p>The protagonist Ike was raised far removed from these racial tensions, and at the start of the game knows very little about laguz at all. It is in part his unconditional willingness to learn and accept laguz for who they are that allows him to not only rally the cause of multiple laguz tribes to his aid, but to also help mend the wider rift between the beorc and laguz.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312640\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-312640\"><img alt=\"The new laguz characters such as Lethe add a new aspect to the combat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The new laguz characters such as Lethe add a new aspect to the combat.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg 900w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/12165/312640-lethe.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new laguz characters such as Lethe add a new aspect to the combat.</figcaption></figure><p>As in other games in the Fire Emblem series, Path of Radiance is a <a href=\"/tactical-turn-based-combat/3015-234/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-234\">turn-based strategy</a> RPG in which the player must complete a series of missions by moving units around a <a href=\"/grid-based-movement/3015-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1318\">grid-based map</a> and defeat enemies in order to complete objectives. Many of the standard classes return, including fighters, cavaliers, pegasus knights, and mages, among others. However, an all-new unit type introduced in the game come in the form of the laguz.</p><p>Laguz units have a special meter associated with them that governs when they are able to transform. The meter either fills or depletes by a specific amount each turn. When the meter is filled to maximum, the laguz will take their animal form, and when it empties, they will revert to their humanoid form. When in animal form, their movement increases, and they're able to attack and defend themselves. However, in humanoid form, they move with a much more limited range, and are unable to fight. To circumvent this, the player may acquire and use laguz stones, temporary, one-use items that will instantly fill a laguz character's meter and instantly transform them. Some laguz, such as the laguz royalty, also come with special equipment that allows them to stay in their animal forms indefinitely at the cost of a stat reduction.</p><p>In combat, the effectiveness of each laguz is governed by its type. Members of the beast laguz tribe, made up of lions, tigers, and large cats, are agile and strong, but are susceptible to fire attacks. The members of the dragon laguz are slow, but incredibly powerful. However, they are weak against thunder magic. Members of the hawk and crow tribes are both capable of flight, with the hawks being the stronger and the crows being the more agile. However, both are weak against wind magic, and they also share the standard Fire Emblem flying unit's weakness against archers.</p><p>The members of the heron clan are also capable of flight, but are not capable of combat and are very fragile. They can, however, use their galdrar to grant adjacent units that have already acted a second action before the turn is up, similar in nature to bards and dancers of previous Fire Emblem titles.</p><h3>Leveling Up and Changing Classes</h3><p>In Path of Radiance, characters will level up when they receive a hundred experience points. When beorc units of a lower-tier class gain enough experience to reach the equivalent of Level 21, they will automatically promote to the next class. This promotion can be triggered early by using special seal items on characters that are Level 10 at minimum. However, certain characters such as Ike do not promote in the standard way; instead, their promotions are story events and cannot be triggered in any other fashion.</p><p>When a cavalier unit is promoted to the paladin class, the player is given the choice to select the character's new secondary weapon type. They may choose any of the three weapon types outside of their default weapon. (i.e.: Astrid, who begins as a mounted archer, may choose between swords, axes, or lances.) Similarly, mages that are promoted to sages may choose between gaining the ability to use daggers or healing staves.</p><p>Laguz units cannot change classes.</p><h3>Support Relationships</h3><p>As in earlier games, Path of Radiance features <a href=\"/support-relationship/3015-2860/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2860\">support conversations and relationships</a>. However, this game only requires that units participate in a certain number of battles together for these conversations to become available, rather than force the units to end a specific number of turns adjacent to each other. Further, the conversations themselves take place from the Camp screen between battles, rather than during battle.</p><h3>Weapon Forging</h3><p>The player will eventually gain access to a special weapon forge between battles. At the expense of gold, the player can create weapons with unique properties by selecting the weapon type, the material it's made from, and then adjust the stats accordingly. Such weapons can be used by any unit with the weapon level necessary to wield the weapon class in question.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders is the sequel to <a href=\"/kingdom-under-fire-a-war-of-heroes/3030-24456/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24456\">Kingdom Under Fire: War of Heroes</a> and continues the storyline 50 years later. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders is a real-time strategy game that alternates its gameplay with hack and slash style of <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> combat and adds some minor role-playing elements. Before entering battle, the player can control where he wants his various units/armies to go via a mini-map. When the main character's army engages in battle with the enemy, the gameplay switches to real-time controlling third-person hack and slash combat.</p><h3>Units</h3><p>Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders includes these unit types: </p><ul><li>Airborne Units - Engages units from the air. Only archers, special ballistas, and magic can attack them.</li><li>Archers - Fire at air and ground targets. Dark Legion archers can fire from horseback.</li><li>Artillery - Engage units from long range.</li><li>Cavalry - Disrupts enemy ranks and causes massive troop damage.</li><li>Infantry - Basic melee units.</li><li>Mortars - Fire at ground targets and can take down castle walls. (Human Alliance exclusive)</li><li>Orc Ghouls - Orcs risen from the grave that have high defence but are vulnerable to holy damage. They can be sent to destroy a siege weapon as a suicide bomber.</li><li>Sappers - Lay traps that damage the enemy and can set fire to forests. Sappers can be used as a substitute for infantry. Human Alliance sappers lay mines which yield greater damage.</li><li>Scorpions - Can be used as infantry or take down castle walls as infantry. Scorpions are immune to arrow damage. (Dark Legion exclusive)</li><li>Spearmen - Special infantry units that can immobilize enemy troops in front of them and can take down cavalry. The Dark Legion version of spearmen are orc axemen.</li><li>Support Units - Units that can cause massive damage to the enemy. These units can be bomber wings, dirigibles, storm riders, swamp mammoths, or wyverns.</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Xbox Live</h2><p>Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders has online multiplayer in gametypes such as head-to-head and deathmatch. Online ranks were kept on leaderboards.</p>",

Released in 1992, Ultima VII is set in the mythical realm of <a href=\"/britannia/3035-416/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-416\">Britannia </a>and features the hero character of the series known as <a href=\"/avatar/3005-2025/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2025\">The Avatar</a>. The story takes the Avatar back to Britannia, where 200 years have passed since the events of the previous game, <a href=\"/ultima-vi-the-false-prophet/3030-10012/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10012\">Ultima VI: The False Prophet</a>.</p><p>The game was also ported to the Super Nintendo (in 1994) and Mac. The SNES version saw both US and Japan releases. Ultima VII: The Black Gate ends of a cliffhanger that is resolved in <a href=\"/ultima-vii-part-two-serpent-isle/3030-8878/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8878\">Ultima VII Part 2: Serpent Isle</a>. It also received an expansion disk named <a href=\"/ultima-vii-the-forge-of-virtue/3030-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1347\">Forge of Virtue</a>. Ultima VII and its sequel and expansions were also included in numerous Ultima compilations.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>After being contacted through his computer by a mysterious red entity, the Avatar enters the moongate in his backyard and travels through the gate from Earth to Britannia. He finds himself in the town of Trinsic, where a gruesome double murder has taken place. In the process of uncovering the clues towards solving the murders, the Avatar first comes in contact with The Fellowship, a new philosophical organization founded by a druid named <a href=\"/batlin/3005-3310/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3310\">Batlin</a>. The Fellowship follow a new doctrine which conflicts with the Eight Virtues enshrined by <a href=\"/lord-british/3005-1401/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1401\">Lord British</a>, but make a great deal of how they have improved the lives of Britannia's citizens. After leaving Trinsic, the Avatar discovers that the magic users of the world are going crazy, and that the strange material blackrock is somehow connected to it. By following the trail of two of The Fellowship's leaders, the Avatar uncovers the true origins and purpose of the group. After foiling the attempt of the Guardian to invade through the Black Gate, the Avatar finds himself trapped in Britannia and unable to return to Earth.</p><p>The Black Gate is the first installment of \"The Age of Apocalypse,\" the final story arc of the main Ultima series. It strikes a darker tone than its predecessors, which becomes apparent when one of the first things the player encounters is a blood-soaked, grisly murder scene. Corruption -- in both political and spiritual forms -- is one of the game's major themes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4910/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4910/272034-u7inv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272034\"><img alt=\"inventory system\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4910/272034-u7inv.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/4910/272034-u7inv.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>inventory system</figcaption></figure><p>Ultima VII features a sophisticated skill and inventory system that allows the player to develop the character in ways that match their playing style. Along the way, the Avatar will meet new NPCs, and old friends from past games who they can invite into their party. While Ultima VII was not the first game in the series to feature mouse support, it was the first to feature a \"point and click\" user interface as its preferred form of input.</p><p>An expansion pack <a href=\"/ultima-vii-the-forge-of-virtue/3030-1347/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1347\">Ultima VII: The Forge of Virtue</a> was released in 1992. It is included in most later releases of the game.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>At the time of its release, Ultima VII was known for being very demanding on PC system resources. Contributing to this fact was the game's use of the problematic Voodoo Memory Manager, which was incompatible with other memory managers.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427328\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2427328\"><img alt=\"EA's Tetrahedron Generator\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"EA's Tetrahedron Generator\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 640w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/136461/2427328-tetheradon.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>EA's Tetrahedron Generator</figcaption></figure><p>Ultima VII was the last Ultima game to be published before Origin Systems was bought by <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts</a>. Like Ultima VI before it, the game included several veiled jabs at EA, as Origin had a tumultuous relationship with the publisher even before the takeover. In the game, the evil Guardian uses three Blackrock Generators to disrupt magic throughout Britannia and broadcast his insidious messages into the minds of its populace. The three generators were built in the shape of a cube, a sphere and a tetrahedron, matching the appearance of the original <a href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/all-images/52-201475/electronic_arts/51-1777475/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">Electronic Arts logo</a>.</p><p>The Super Nintendo port of Ultima VII was severely shortened and simplified, leaving out many of the game's darker elements.</p><h2>Exult</h2><p>As Ultima VII is DOS game that is unable to play correctly on Windows XP and beyond, the fan community created a program that allows users to play it on those operating systems. Exult is an emulator designed to allow people who own legitimate copies of Ultima VII to play it on modern operating systems. Development was originally started by Jeff Freedman specifically for the X Window System, hence Ex-Ult. Since it's original development it has been ported across a number of platforms from Windows PCs to Pocket PCs, Linux and OSX.</p><p>Exult allows players to play through both the original Ultima VII: The Black Gate (with The Forge of Virtue add on) and the sequel Ultima VII: Serpent Isle (with The Silver Seed add on) campaigns. The developers not only allowed players to relive the experience of Ultima VII but also allowed for changes and tweaks to be added to the game and its interfaces.</p><p>One minor interface change that was added to a version of Exult was to give players the option to use the \"Paperdoll\" inventory system from Serpent Isle in Black Gate. A more recent and larger change was added in the form of craftable items and extra quests. While this required the player download various hacked data files it provided an extension of the original gameplay.</p><p>While the Exult project has no official support from EA (the current owners of the Ultima franchise) developers of the original game have shown their support, most notably Richard Garriott, who in a letter to the Exult team wrote:</p><blockquote><p>\" Just so that you know. On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this. Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems that run them go away\"</p></blockquote><h2>Availability</h2><p>This game is currently available at <a href=\"/good-old-games/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">gog.com</a> and is included in the \"Ultima 7 Complete Edition\" package.</p>",

      "deck": "Take the role of Wolverine, Iceman and Nightcrawler and use their superpowers through a series of missions.",
      "description": "<p>X-Men: The Official game was a movie tie-in game released in 2006. The game covers the events of X2 and X-men: The Last Stand. The game also fills in the gap between the two films, and explains why Nightcrawler is not present in The Last Stand.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Below are details on the three character's playable on home console only:</p><h3>Wolverine</h3><p>Wolverine’s segments aren’t very complex in terms of gameplay and design. The player controls Wolverine through a set of environments which are usually ground level. A horde of enemies are present - In which case the player must button-mash to work his/her way through. Most of Wolverines attacks are based on his claws. He can block and perform various slash based attacks. Wolverine also has two special abilities – One is the ability to recharge health, and the other is called ‘Fury’ which increases his speed and strength.</p><h3>Nightcrawler</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504709\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504709\"><img alt=\"Wolverine mashing some foes.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg 1024w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/2522/504709-wolverine_xmenog5.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Wolverine mashing some foes.</figcaption></figure><p>Nightcrawler is probably the most interesting and enjoyable character to play as in the game. The majority of level design is based in the air and involves climbing and swinging from various objects. There aren’t many enemies present during Nightcrawler’s missions. This means the player must use stealth to work his/her way through. Nightcrawler’s ability to fight is superior to the other characters. He has many abilities which can help him in different situations. One of Nightcrawler’s specialities is to turn invisible. This gives players the chance to generate his health and stay out of trouble. Another unique ability is dash – This allows players to quickly move from object to object, and confuse enemies as to Nightcrawler’s whereabouts.</p><h3>Iceman</h3><p>Iceman’s missions are high-speed and set in the air. Combat is usually based around fighting flying enemies. Iceman can use three different attacks to take down his foe – This first is ‘Ice Beam’ (which can also be used to extinguish fire), the second ‘Hail Storm’, and the third is ‘Frost Shield’ which cancels out any damage for a certain period of time. The player can perform a speed boast and 180° turn when controlling Iceman, but this often feels flawed and unnatural.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><p>There are a total of six playable characters in X-Men: The Official Game (only three of them present in home consoles).</p><h3>All consoles:</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-10\" href=\"/wolverine/3005-10/\">Wolverine</a></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2391\" href=\"/nightcrawler/3005-2391/\">Nightcrawler</a></p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-4716\" href=\"/iceman/3005-4716/\">Iceman</a></p><h3>Unique to handheld consoles:</h3><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2281\" href=\"/magneto/3005-2281/\">Magneto</a> (Nintendo DS)</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2382\" href=\"/colossus/3005-2382/\">Colossus</a> (GBA)</p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2850\" href=\"/cyclops/3005-2850/\">Cyclops</a> (Mobile)</p><h2>Xbox 360 Installation</h2><p>The amount of memory it takes to install this game is 6.4 GB.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Revenge of Shinobi (JP: The Super Shinobi) is a ninja action game from Sega and part of their <a href=\"/shinobi/3025-362/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-362\">Shinobi</a> franchise, released exclusively for their fledgling Genesis console in 1989. The opposing ninja clan from the original <a href=\"/shinobi/3030-3482/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3482\"> Shinobi</a>, Zeed, has returned as Neo Zeed. They seek revenge on <a href=\"/joe-musashi/3005-362/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-362\"> Joe Musashi</a>, wiping out his clan and kidnapping his fiancée.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game is a 2D <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\"> side-scrolling</a> brawler. Joe is armed with <a href=\"/shuriken/3055-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-51\"> shuriken</a> (though they resemble <a href=\"/kunai/3055-358/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-358\">kunai</a>) for distance attacks and ninja magic to handle difficult bosses. He is armed with the Ninjitsu, or quite simply, Ninja Magic. The game consists of differing difficulty levels, with the higher difficulty levels having more enemies, less ability to handle damage, and fewer lives to start with.</p><h2>Ninjitsu</h2><p>Special techniques that the player can use that can cause massive damage, increase mobility, and provide invulnerability.</p><h4>Ikazuchi, the Art of Thunder</h4><p>Joe calls upon Thunder to surround him with its protection. While enveloped in Ikazuchi, Joe will not be injured and his Life Bar won't decrease. After taking several enemy hits, Ikazuchi fades away.</p><h4>Kariu, the Art of the Fire Dragon</h4><p>Assume this jitsu to envelop Joe in a fire column, which then spits and travels, scorching every enemy it touches. Kariu is over when the fire columns disappear.</p><h4>Fushin, the Art of Floating</h4><p>Increase Joe's jumping prowess with this jitsu. When Joe assumes Fushin, his jumps and somersaults have maximum height and distance. Fushin stays with Joe until the scene ends, even if he assumes another jitsu.</p><h4>Mijin, the Art of Pulverizing</h4><p>By assuming Mijin Joe becomes a human explosion that destroys everything in its blast. Mijin is best used as a desperate last resort, when the life bar is short. Mihin takes a life, so the player must make sure they have at least one other life remaining.</p><h2>Crates</h2><p>Inside crates the player will find a variety of items that can both help or hinder their progress.</p><ul><li><strong>Power Pack</strong>: Increases Joe's strength and adds to his weapons. He throws his shuriken faster and more accurately, gains a lethal sword for combat, and applies the skill of Cross Guard, warding off enemy shuriken with his own.</li><li><strong>5 Shuriken</strong>: Joe gains five more throwing knives.</li><li><strong>20 Shuriken</strong>: Joe acquires twenty more throwing knives.</li><li><strong>Small Heart</strong>: Joe's Life Bar gains two small bars.</li><li><strong>Large Heart</strong>: Joe's Life Bar increases to full strength.</li><li><strong>Musashi</strong>: Joe gains an extra life.</li><li><strong>Ninjitsu</strong>: Ninjitsu (ninja magic) can be used again in the same life, even if Joe's used it already.</li><li><strong>Bomb</strong>: An explosive that detonates either when Joe touches it or its time runs down. Damages Joe if caught in its explosion.</li></ul><h2>Legacy</h2><p>The Revenge of Shinobi has some infamous instances of copyright infringement. The game had bosses who very closely resembled <a href=\"/spider-man/3025-576/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-576\"> Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/batman/3025-49/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-49\"> Batman</a>, <a href=\"/godzilla/3025-245/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-245\"> Godzilla</a> and <a href=\"/terminator/3025-296/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-296\"> The Terminator</a>. All Bosses were altered or replaced in later versions of the game: In version 1.01 Batman was replaced by a bat-like mutant, in 1.02 Spiderman is re-designed to look more like the character (because Sega was developing <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-vs-the-kingpin/3030-20388/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20388\"> The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin</a> for the Genesis at the time) also the bat creature is removed from the battle entirely, and in 1.03 Godzilla is replaced by a skeletal dinosaur. The copyright issues have been a major reason why the game is not often included in Sega compilation discs. The <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\"> Virtual Console</a> version has a totally unique version where Spider-Man had a palette swap, but identical abilities (this is due to the license for using Spider-Man was for only limited time, that license is now owned by <a href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\"> Activision</a>).</p><h2>SEGA AGES</h2><p>As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd 2012 in Japan (by its Japanese title, The Super Shinobi). For the PlayStation 3, the title was released for ¥600. For the Xbox 360, the title was released in a bundle with <a href=\"/alex-kidd-in-miracle-world/3030-9101/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9101\"> Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a> and <a href=\"/super-hang-on/3030-18692/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18692\"> Super Hang-On</a> for 800 MS Points.</p>",

      "deck": "NS blends first-person combat with real-time strategy. It features intense \"marines vs. aliens\" teamplay, where one marine can become \"Commander\" and leads players from a top-down perspective.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Natural Selection is a multiplayer modification of the original Half-Life game developed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment and released in October 31, 2002. The game attempts to blend real-time strategy elements to a first-person shooter with a two-team basis, marines and aliens. On any given level, the aliens have the ability to create Hives in specific places and in these Hives the aliens can spawn in and create a base camp of sorts, whereas the Marines are attempting to prevent the creation of Hives. Each team can build structures on resource nodes in order to get resources for team upgrades. The game is won when one side is completely eliminated with no possibility of respawning.</p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p><b>Classic</b> -- The traditional game mode in which each team tries to completely eliminate the other team's bases or hives. In this mode, one marine will take the role of the Commander who issues orders to the team. Resources are gained by capturing resource nodes, or by killing a member of the opposite team. In this mode there are three hive locations in which the aliens can capture, with each hive capture the aliens will gain access to more abilities and upgrades. Strategies for this mode on the Frontiersmen is to 'lock down' one or two hive locations to prevent the aliens from capturing them.</p><p><b>Combat</b> -- Combat mode is a quick alternative to the standard gameplay mode introduced in version 3.0 of Natural Selection. In this mode there are no RTS elements to speak of. The Commander position as well resource nodes no longer exist. Each player is awarded experience points by being involved in combat, and with those experience points they can get any upgrade of their choice. The marines have one command chair and the aliens have one Hive, the team to destroy their opposing main structure first is the winner. Unlike Classic, Combat usually has a timelimit tied to it, which in the case of time running out, the defending team usually marked as the aliens are the winners of the round, while the attacking team are considered the losers.</p><h2>Frontiersmen (Marines)</h2><h3>Commander</h3><p>The RTS elements are most applicable to the Commander on the Marines team. As the Commander, he has a top-down view of the battlefield area while in the Command Chair. From here, he can assign squads, issue attack orders, issue build orders, and drop supplies for his team. No marine can drop any given structure, however marines are required as builders for the structures dropped onto the battlefield, without them the structures are unusable. Likewise, no upgrades or item drops can occur without the Commander issuing it. As such, the Commander is very much the leader of the marines and they are dependent on the Commander for victory. Likewise, without good marines following orders, victory is difficult to attain.</p><p><b>Marine Structures</b></p><ul><li>Command Chair - The structure in which the Commander operates from.</li><li>Infantry Portal - Spawns Marine players with a Light Machine Gun, Pistol, and a Knife (and a Grenade if they have been researched)</li><li>Armory - Dispenses health and ammo, is required to drop shotguns, wielders and mines. Can be upgraded into an Advanced Armory which can drop Heavy Machine Guns and Grenade Launchers</li><li>Arms Lab - Requires Armory. Upgrades Weapons and Armor to a maximum of three levels. Can research Catalyst Packs here.</li><li>Resource Tower - Gathers resources for the team, can be electrified to inflict close range damage</li><li>Turret Factory - Gives the ability to drop turrets so long it is in range of the Turret Factory. Can be upgraded to an Advanced Turret Factory which can drop Siege Turrets</li></ul><ul><li>Sentry Turret - Requires Turret Factory. Standard turret which attacks non-cloaked alien lifeforms</li><li>Siege Turrets - Requires Advanced Turret Factory. Only attacks alien structures and can shoot through walls as long as the structure is spotted first.</li><li>Prototype Lab - Requires Advanced armory and Arms Lab. Allows for research of Heavy Armor and Jetpacks.</li><li>Observatory - Requires Armory. Allows for research of Motion Tracking and Phase Tech. Can scan areas of the map to reveal any alien structures or lifeforms. Will also reveal any lifeforms and structures in a large radius from where it is built.

Each fighter has their own <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">life bar</a>, which depletes after each successful attack. The winner of the round is decided after either the game's <a href=\"/countdown-timer/3015-1061/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1061\">countdown timer</a> expires or one of the fighters is <a href=\"/knock-out/3015-313/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-313\">\"knocked out\"</a> (by emptying their life bar).</p><p>Typically a match is won by winning two out of three rounds, but a <a href=\"/double-knock-out/3015-1768/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1768\">Double KO</a> (in which both players are knocked out simultaneously) or a <a href=\"/draw/3015-621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-621\">Draw Game</a> (when the game's timer expires and both players having equal vitality remaining) extends the match for another round (while no victor is declared). If the match extends to ten total rounds (four total rounds in the game's updates) and no winner is declared, then both players lose the match.</p><p>When players are facing off against computer opponents, they must progress through each opponent throughout the game and defeat them. Losing a match allows players to <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continue</a>, in which players can pick a different fighter (if desired) and restart the fight. If a player manages to defeat all seven opponents, he must face three Grand Masters: American former professional <a href=\"/boxer/3015-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-13\">boxer</a> <a href=\"/balrog/3005-61/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-61\">Balrog</a>, Spanish cage fighter <a href=\"/vega/3005-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-30\">Vega</a>, and the master of Muay Thai, <a href=\"/sagat/3005-102/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-102\">Sagat</a> (the final boss from the previous game). It is revealed after defeating Sagat that the player must fight the mysterious dictator <a href=\"/m-bison/3005-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-185\">M. Bison</a> to win the tournament. Each of the eight playable fighters have unique endings showing the aftermath of their battle with M. Bison.</p><p>Fights between players and CPU opponents can be interrupted by another player (causing the message \"HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!\" to appear), which triggers a new one-on-one match between the two players in which the winner moves on to fight the current CPU opponent.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>Like the basic version of the original Street Fighter, players have a eight-directional joystick (used for movement) and six buttons in a horizontal rectangular formation (used for attacking). Each of the six buttons corresponds to a different attack type (three \"Punch\" attacks and three \"Kick\" attacks) and strength/speed (two Light attacks, two Medium attacks, and two Heavy attacks). Light attacks are safer to perform (despite dealing less damage) while Heavy attacks deal powerful damage (despite leaving the fighter in a vulnerable state if the attack misses).</p><p>While walking in one of two directions by holding the joystick in one of two positions (Back for walking away from their opponent and Forward for walking towards their opponent), players can <a href=\"/crouching/3015-378/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-378\">crouch</a> down by holding the joystick in one of the three downward positions (Down, Down-Back, and Down-Forward) and jump up by tapping the joystick in one of the three upward positions (Up for jumping up, Up-Back for jumping away from their opponent, and Up-Forward for jumping towards their opponent). Certain attacks miss when their ducked under or jumped over, while these maneuvers also give new attack options (such as, for crouching players, an anti-air <a href=\"/uppercut/3015-1128/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1128\">uppercut</a> and a <a href=\"/sweep-kick/3015-3119/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3119\">leg sweep</a> capable of knocking down opponents).</p><p>Players who are hit with multiple attacks in quick succession have a high chance of becoming <a href=\"/stun/3015-1577/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1577\">\"dizzied\"</a>. Visualized by a halo of stars around the fighter's head, dizzied opponents are stunned and cannot move or attack until they either receive another hit or \"break out\" of their dizzy state (by tapping multiple buttons and moving the joystick around).</p><h4>Advanced Abilities</h4><p>Using the joystick, players can also perform <a href=\"/blocking/3015-1843/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">blocks</a> (known in Japanese version as \"guards\") by holding the joystick in either the Back position (for standing blocks) or Down-Back position (for crouching blocks). Blocked players receive no damage or knockback/knockdown from normal attacks, but are more vulnerable to Grab Attacks (which throw the opponent in a desired direction, damaging them in the process). Grabs are performed by holding either Back or Forward on the joystick (the direction choosing which way to throw the opponent) and pressing Medium Punch or Heavy Punch while the opponent is very close and not jumping.</p><p>Along with a variety of normal attacks (some of which are different depending on how close the opponent is), each fighter has a set of secret <a href=\"/special-attacks/3015-327/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">\"special moves\"</a> performed by specific joystick and button combinations. These techniques have special abilities (such as throwing a projectile across the screen or hurling the fighters at their opponents) and can deal more damage (even slightly damaging blocked opponents, later known as <a href=\"/chip-damage/3015-2474/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2474\">\"chip damage\"</a>). In some cases, fighters may receive double damage if hit during the execution of a special move. This doesn't apply universally--only some fighters and some moves lead to this vulnerability (Blanka's rolling attack and Sagat's Tiger Uppercut to name a few). This vulnerability made it into the SNES port, but was removed in later revisions of Street Fighter II and their respective home ports.</p><p>Originally determined as a bug, players can \"cancel\" attack animations into other attacks, allowing players to chain several attacks and special moves into a <a href=\"/combo/3015-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-18\">\"combo\"</a>. This technique was soon adapted as a standard feature of the fighting game franchise and was expanded throughout the Street Fighter series.</p><h3>Bonus Stages</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/73970/1495552-0039.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495552\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58333333333333\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/73970/1495552-0039.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495552\"><img alt=\"Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/7/73970/1495552-0039.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/7/73970/1495552-0039.png 384w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/7/73970/1495552-0039.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/7/73970/1495552-0039.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/7/73970/1495552-0039.png 384w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/7/73970/1495552-0039.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ryu destroys a car with his bare hands (and feet).</figcaption></figure><p>After defeating every three CPU opponents, players participate in a <a href=\"/bonus-stage/3015-646/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-646\">bonus stage</a> for additional score. Each bonus stage has their own unique objective:</p><ol><li>Wreck a car located in the middle of the stage with a variety of attacks in a limited amount of time, in similar vein to the bonus stage in <a href=\"/final-fight/3030-6722/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6722\">Final Fight</a>. As pieces of the car fly off, players often have to change attacks and positions.</li><li>Break wooden <a href=\"/barrel/3055-82/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-82\">barrels</a> that drop down above the middle of the stage. Barrels roll towards each direction and can knock down the player if it hits them.</li><li>Destroy a pyramid of metal <a href=\"/oil-drum/3055-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-347\">oil drums</a> stacked in the middle of the stage in a limited amount of time. The drums take more damage to destroy than the barrels and can be knocked back (only if barrels below them are destroyed). Players can be knocked down by the oil drums, either through impact (when the oil drums are knocked back) or by fire (standing on an oil drum at the wrong time, since the oil inside is being burned).</li></ol><p>Most console ports of the game (and its updates) replaced the third bonus stage with a large pyramid of bricks to destroy in a limited amount of time. Each section of the pyramid is impacted by attacks and is destroyed after a certain amount.</p><p>While it is usually performed by one player, a second player can join in (resetting the stage) to assist. Players receive score per each hit on the objective, and both players receive a bonus score for successfully completing the objective.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>The game features eight playable characters, all with their own unique set of special moves (with the exception of <a href=\"/ken-masters/3005-212/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-212\">Ken</a>, who has the same special moves as <a href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu</a>) and fight locales.

It's one of the first games to have a dedicated Versus Mode (allowing players to select stages and <a href=\"/two-difficulty-levels-at-once/3015-4331/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4331\">player handicaps</a>). The game also had <a href=\"/mirror-match/3015-2541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2541\">mirror match</a> support as a cheat code. It was later re-released digitally for the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> (on December 25, 2006) and <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> (on August 22, 2013). The port to SNES--by many measures, very faithful to the arcade--lost a few details along the way (for example, showcasing two pairs of elephants in Dhalsim's stage as opposed to three); another key difference was the instrumentation in the soundtrack, which was reworked to take advantage of the console's sample-based sound chip and showcased instruments that were often vastly different from the FM synth coming out of the arcade board (e.g. the trumpets used to blare out the melody in Guile's stage on the SNES).</li></ul><ul><li>Between 1992 and 1993, the game was ported to a variety of computers by <a href=\"/creative-materials/3010-2001/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2001\">Creative Materials</a> (<a href=\"/amiga/3045-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga</a>, <a href=\"/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-11\">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href=\"/atari-st/3045-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\">Atari ST</a>, <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>, and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PCs</a> running MS-DOS) and <a href=\"/tiertex-design-studios/3010-1638/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1638\">Tiertex Design</a> (<a href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-16\">ZX Spectrum</a>). All of these ports were published by <a href=\"/us-gold-ltd/3010-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-67\">U.S. Gold</a> in Europe only (the only exception being the PC version, which received an obscure North America release) and had numerous issues regarding audio, graphics, and gameplay.</li></ul><ul><li>A handheld port was released for the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> in September 1995. Including some assets and moves from later Street Fighter II releases (though resembling more like the original) and a <a href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\">Survival Mode</a>, the port has numerous restrictions (including reliance on only two attack buttons and three absent characters: <a href=\"/e-honda/3005-271/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-271\">E. Honda</a>, <a href=\"/dhalsim/3005-427/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-427\">Dhalsim</a>, and <a href=\"/vega/3005-30/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-30\">Vega</a>). Like other fighting games for the Game Boy, multiplayer requires a Link Cable and multiple copies of the game and device. This version has full <a href=\"/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4804\">Super Game Boy</a> support, including enhanced border backgrounds (that change depending on the current stage), limited color support (mostly for lifebars), and same-console multiplayer.</li></ul><ul><li>It was later ported, along with the <a href=\"/street-fighter-ii-champion-edition/3030-1096/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1096\">\"Champion Edition\"</a> and <a href=\"/street-fighter-ii-turbo-hyper-fighting/3030-8161/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8161\">\"Hyper Fighting\"</a> versions, for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Sony PlayStation</a> and <a href=\"/saturn/3045-42/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Sega Saturn</a> (exclusively in Japan) as the <a href=\"/street-fighter-collection-2/3030-12151/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12151\">Street Fighter Collection 2</a> compilation (known in Japan as <em>Capcom Generation: Dai-go-shuu Kakutouka-tachi</em>). Released on October 31, 1998 in North America, December 3, 1998 in Japan, and May 1999 in Europe (by <a href=\"/virgin-interactive-entertainment-inc/3010-176/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-176\">Virgin</a>), this port includes a dedicated Versus and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/training-mode/3015-1767/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1767\">Training Mode</a>, optional arranged soundtracks, and a \"Super Vs. Mode\" (which allows players to fight with different character versions, which was later expanded on in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/hyper-street-fighter-ii-the-anniversary-edition/3030-14918/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14918\">Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition</a>).

Although the \"II\" in the title would imply that a prequel had been published, this is only somewhat true; the original CheetahMen game was the last minigame in the NES game entitled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14329\" href=\"/action-52/3030-14329/\" slug=\"action-52\">Action 52</a>. Despite the fact that the game already had packaging and was in a shippable state, the game never saw a commercial release. Nevertheless, in 1997, collectors managed to find 1,500 copies of the game lying in a warehouse, and the it became infamous for its poor gameplay, which contains noticeable <a data-ref-id=\"3015-511\" href=\"/glitch/3015-511/\" slug=\"glitch\">glitches</a>. It is notoriously known as one of the worst NES games ever made. Even the actual game cartridge is poorly done, as it is merely a recycled Action 52 game cartridge with a CheetahMen II sticker applied to the underside, misspelled, \"Cheetamen.\"</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay essentially consists of rudimentary platforming in which the CheetahMen traipse through to the levels' end in order to continue onward. After every two levels, which culminate in a corresponding <a data-ref-id=\"3015-50\" href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" slug=\"boss-fight\">boss fight</a>, the playable CheetahMan is switched out. Each one has a weapon which they can use to defeat enemies. However, because some enemies lie low to the ground, the CheetahMen are unable to attack them due to their inability to kneel and duck. Others can be attacked, but unless they are defeated before reaching the CheetahMan, the CheetahMan is forced to take damage while the enemy remains alive and proceeds to keep moving forward.</p><h2>Glitches</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/535192-cm2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-535192\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/535192-cm2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-535192\"><img alt=\"The Ape Man has a part in the game's most infamous glitch.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/429/535192-cm2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/429/535192-cm2.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The Ape Man has a part in the game's most infamous glitch.</figcaption></figure><p>CheetahMen II contains glitches which range from minor to outright insurmountable. For example, in the first level, if the player turns left and jumps twice, the CheetahMan becomes <a data-ref-id=\"3015-317\" href=\"/invisibility/3015-317/\" slug=\"invisibility\">invisibile</a> and also partially enters the ground. Additionally, when playing as the second CheetahMan, it is possible to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-379\" href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" slug=\"jump\">jump</a> in such a way that he reaches the sky and then <a data-ref-id=\"3015-8\" href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" slug=\"teleportation\">teleports</a> to the bottom of the screen. The most major glitches, however, involve the boss battle with the Ape Man. Besides the fact that Ape Man actually causes no damage and simply runs through the same animation, it is impossible to finish the game under normal circumstances after defeating him. The CheetahMan is simply stuck at that screen. Additional levels which are meant to take place after that fight can be accessed, but they require the use of cheating devices.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert is the second installment in the real-time strategy series Command &amp; Conquer and was released in 1996. It is set in an alternate universe, depicting a fictional war of the Allied Forces with the Soviets, who invade Europe after World War II was prevented by Einsteins Chronosphere experiments.</p><p>As a classic RTS game, Red Alert features a Single Player Campaign, containing 15 missions each for the Allied and Soviet forces, and a fully functioning Multiplayer Mode for up to 8 players on small to large-sized custom maps. Along with the game itself, developer Westwood Studios published a tool called Westwood Chat to provide an opportunity for the players to meet in chat rooms and organize Multiplayer matches with an easy setup.</p><p>Beside its excellent gameplay and mission design, Red Alert was critically acclaimed for the authentic high-quality cutscenes, good acting performance and an exceptional soundtrack.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>After his escape from the German regime in World War II, famous Albert Einstein moves to the US and starts experiments in a facility in Trinity, New Mexico. In 1946 he achieves a breakthrough on Chronosphere technology, which makes it possible to travel back and forth in time. With help from an unnamed assistant, Einstein goes back in time and removes Adolf Hitler from the timeline with a simple handshake after he was released from prison in 1924 in Landsberg. Einstein's plan to prevent World War II succeeds; but instead of Germany rising to power under the National Socialist Party, an industrialized and powerful Soviet Union with leader Stalin quickly becomes the red menace and main threat to the free world. Several European countries fall to Stalins troops and the Soviet war machine seems unstoppable; but even though the Allied Forces are outgunned, they are not outsmarted. After rescuing Einstein from his imprisonment in a small Soviet base, the Allies manage to slowly regain lost terrain and eventually get the chance to fight back and save Europe from the communist oppressors.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Allied Forces</h3><p>Gunter von Esling</p><p>General Gunter von Esling is the supreme commander of the Allied troops. As an experienced general, he is very diplomatic, highly skilled in military tactics and determined to fight back the invasion of the Red Army with all might and main. Together with Stavros, Von Esling is usually also responsible for Allied mission briefings.</p><p>Nikos Stavros</p><p>Stavros is a Greek general and the second commander in the Allied ranks. He is filled with hatred against the Soviets and wants to crush Stalin and his fellowship as soon as possible. Stavros is good-natured and clever, but also is impatient sometimes and very sensitive regarding his military losses. His tips mostly are very useful and, if being considered, can facilitate many missions.</p><p>Tanya Adams</p><p>When elite units are needed, Tanya Adams is always good to go. Though she basically is a civilian mercenary, Gunter von Esling entrusts several missions to her due to Tanya's valuable qualities on the battlefield. As an excellent shooter she is making short shrift of ground troops and is also highly experienced with explosives, able to raze several military buildings within a short amount of time.</p><p>Albert Einstein</p><p>Einstein plays a very important role in the attempt of the Allies to destroy the Soviet supremacy. After he was rescued from a Soviet base in a special military operation, Einstein provides important scientific information about a secret Soviet project, called the \"Iron Curtain\". Allthough he always seems a little confused and absentminded, he is very appreaciated as the founder of the Chronosphere project, which gives Allied troops the tactical opportunity to teleport target units to distant locations.</p><h3>Soviet Forces</h3><p>Joseph Stalin</p><p>Stalin is the dictator of the Soviets and also the leader of the Red Army; after Hitlers death in Landsberg, no real rival emerged to compete with him for the struggle of suppremacy in Europe. Consequently he gained unprecedented power and was responsible for the Russian invasion in Europe. Focused solely on his plans to dominate all European nations, Stalin acts as a cold blooded ruler and also does not hesitate to chase down or eliminate any critics and traitors.</p><p>Gradenko</p><p>Gradenko is one of the main commanders under the leadership of Josef Stalin. He is known to be highly skilled regarding military tactics and made major contributions to the success of many Soviet operations in the Eurasian and East-European warzones. Nevertheless, his excentric and undiscerning attitude consequently lead to serious mistakes during the development of the Soviet \"Iron Curtain\" project and, among other things, to the escape of Albert Einstein from the Soviet Technology Centre. These failures are fueling his competition thoughts with Nadia and unfortunately menace to crumble Stalin's trust.</p><p>Nadia Zelenkov</p><p>As the head officer of the Soviet secret police Nadia, is portrayed as a pretty, but deceitful and cunning woman; always criticizing and reminding comrade Gradenko of his failures, she is willing to do everything to rise in the ranks of the Russian war machinery. Always following her shady plans, Nadia is also determined to seduce even the most resistant men, including Stalin - because sometimes, beauty is only skin deep.</p><p>Georgy Kukov</p><p>Kukov is a proud, self confident general, who is unquestionably one of the most loyal and compliant followers of the Russian regime. Always interested in a career boost, he is motivated to carry out his military duties and special tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p><p>Kane</p><p>Kane, a bald-headed and serious-looking adviser of Stalin, sporadically appears in mission briefings; initially, his role in the Soviet apparatus remains unclear. It is never revealed which kind of information Kane passes on to Stalin but it seems he is interested in manipulation and subconscious guidance of the Russian leader.</p><h2>Economy</h2><p>In Red Alert, like in many other strategy games, it is required to spend ingame credits for construction of buildings, unit recruitment or repairs of damaged vehicles on the Service Depot. This credits can generally be earned by smelting Ore or by collecting Gemstones.</p><p>Ore is a very common resource and can be found troughout various regions and climatic zones near certain mines. Full Ore Trucks discharge their cargo at the Refineries where the Ore gets broken down in its principal components in a degradation process, isolating different kinds of pure minerals. Gems are much more scarce; they include sapphires, hessonites, rubies as well as emeralds and the value of one load is twice as high as the corresponding amount of Ore, making mining very worthwhile, even in dangerous areas.</p><p>Additional credits can be earned by collecting crates, which can be found at distinct locations or randomly spawn in Multiplayer matches.</p><h3>Allied Ending</h3><p>Following the destruction of the remaining Soviet forces, Allied soldiers find the Stalin buried in the rubble of the former Soviet stronghold. Before recovering Stalin, General Stavros stops them and convinces them to walk away. As the soldiers leave, Stavros stuffs a handkerchief down Stalins throat and places a boulder over his head, walking away with his revenge. This is the canon ending, leading to the events of <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-2/3030-18072/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18072\">Red Alert 2</a>.</p><h3>Soviet Ending</h3><p>The commander joins the Soviet leaders, celebrating their victory over the Allied forces in the newly conquered Buckingham Palace. After congratulating his comrades in a speech, Stalin suddenly starts choking, realizing that his tea has been poisoned by Nadia. Following Stalin's gruesome and slow death, Nadia states that the Brotherhood of NOD is now in command of the Soviet Union. Suddenly Kane appears and Nadia gets killed by a shot in the back, revealing Kane as the true leader and mastermind of NOD.

It adds support for high screen resolutions and adapts the graphical user interface to modern standards. Features like replay support and spectator mode as well as a re-balancing for strategic multiplayer matches make it attractive for competitive gaming.

It also greatly enhances the <a href=\"/mods/3015-417/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-417\">modding</a> capabilities compared to the original games which makes it interesting for the creative community.</p><p> </p><h2>Buildings &amp; Units</h2><h3>Allies</h3><p>Construction Yard<br />The Construction Yard is the heart of every base and is needed for proper construction of buildings; equipped with heavy armor, it is very durable but should be protected with excellent defense systems as in case of destruction of a CY no more buildings can be produced.</p><p>Power Plant<br />Power Plants are one of the most important elements in a base ; they supply all buildings with energy and ensure proper function and speed of unit production. If Power Plants get damaged, it is highly recommended to quickly repair them as their power output is directly proportional to their structural condition.</p><p>Advanced Power Plant<br />Advanced Power Plants perform and share the same functions as their smaller counterparts but are thought to mainly supply high-tech structures like Technology Centres, Anti-Air Guns or Gap Generators. These are much more power-intensive and therefore become inoperative if they are running out of energy, so Advanced Power Plants should always be kept in excellent condition.</p><p>Ore Refinery<br />This factory is required for storing and smelting down ore; in this process the ore is converted to in-game credits which can be used for unit and building production. Every Ore Refinery comes with a heavy-armored Ore Truck to harvest the Ore and transport it back to your base. The storage capacity of the Refinery is limited to ore worth 2000$, so Silos have to be built for higher amounts.</p><p>Ore Silo<br />Silos are needed when the Refinery can't hold any more ore. A Silo can store ore worth 1500$ and should be decently guarded as all credits are lost in case of destruction.</p><p>Tent Barracks<br />The Barracks provide a training ground for several light infantry units such as Rifle or Rocket Soldiers, Medics and Engineers. Additionally, in Multiplayer battles also special units like Tanya or Mechanics are available.</p><p>War Factory<br />War Factories, together with the Barracks, are the backbone of the supply line; they are used for the assembly of light and heavy military vehicles like Tanks, Rangers, Artillery or additional Ore Trucks.</p><p>Naval Yard<br />Allied naval units are deployed in the Naval Yard. Damaged gunboats, destroyers &amp; cruisers also can be repaired at the docks, if necessary.</p><p>Helipad<br />Helipads are required for the construction and maintenance of attack helicopters; despite every Helipad comes with an Apache, it's possible to produce additional helicopters which, however, have to be manually assigned for reloading ammunition if they don't have their own Helipad. Also, repairs of aircraft units have to be carried out on the Service Depot.</p><p>Pillbox<br />Pillowboxes are the basic Allied defense systems, protecting structures from enemy infantry attacks; they are armed with rapidly firing machine guns and can even handle groups of light armored ground units.</p><p>Camouflaged Pillbox<br />Camouflaged Pillboxes are more advanced versions of the classic Pillboxes; they fit in seamlessly with the natural conditions, making them hard to spot and to destroy due to their heavy armor.</p><p>Turret<br />Turrets are effective against all kind of vehicles and heavily armored units; they are harder to destroy than Pillboxes, have a powerful 105mm cannon and also a higher firing range.</p><p>Anti-Aircraft Gun<br />Anti-Aircraft Guns stand out due to their exceptional accuracy and high firing rate, which causes heavy damage or destruction of fighter aircrafts and helicopters when they get too close. Nevertheless, their attack range is relatively small, so enemy units have to fly past in close proximity for a successful attack. Anti-Aircraft Guns are energy-dependent, they will be shut down upon lack of power.</p><p>Service Depot<br />Damaged vehicles or aircraft units can be placed on the Service Depot and within a short amount of time they can be repaired to full health. As less credits have to be spent on a service than for buying a new unit, a full repair is consequently much more cost-efficient. Also Mine Layers can be reloaded and units can be sold when moved onto the Service Depot.</p><p>Radar Dome<br />After building a Radar Dome an overview of the map for revealed terrain becomes available, which is useful for detecting enemy units and spotting attacks early on. If there is not enough energy available or if Power Plants are in bad condition the Radar Dome will shut down temporarily.</p><p>Technology Center<br />Building a Tech Center requires a lot of energy, but advances the technology level and enables production of higher tier units like Cruisers, Mobile Gap Generators or Chronosphere Tanks. After construction has been completed, a GPS satellite will be launched to provide a complete overview for the whole map, completely removing fog of war.</p><p>Gap Generator<br />Stationary Gap Generators are generally used by the Allied forces for hiding their base and units under a black shroud; this makes it more difficult for the enemy to target certain structures as these are only vulnerable for attacks when an enemy unit enters the area around the Gap Generator.</p><p>Chronosphere<br />Introduced and invented by Albert Einstein, the Chronosphere makes it possible to immediately teleport units to remote locations without any time delay. Nevertheless, this ability is temporary limited and the target unit will be returned to its point of origin when the effect runs out.</p><p>Fake Structures*<br />There are 4 Fake Structures available; Construction Yard, War Factory, Radar Dome, and Naval Yard can be build in Multiplayer matches to deceive the enemy by distracting them from the location of the actual base.</p><p>Sandbag Barrier<br />Sandbags are useful to stop infantry units like Rifle Infantry or Engineers from base infiltration operations; unfortunately Sandbags can easily be destroyed by Grenadiers or heavily-armored vehicles which just have to drive right through the barrier.</p><p>Concrete Barrier<br />It's always recommended to build Concrete Walls when they are available as these are more durable than Sandbags and need several hits by Tanks, V2 Rocket Launchers or Grenadiers before they colapse. Tracked vehicles also can't drive through and have to destroy them before.</p><p>Rifle Infantry<br />Standard Rifle Infantry units are mostly efficient against other infantry and can cope with light armored vehicles, when gathered in groups.</p><p>Medic<br />Medics are very welcome when someone is hurt in a fight; equipped with Medipacks they can heal up infantry units within a short amount of time. As they are unarmed, Medics require protection and never should be left alone on the battlefield.</p><p>Rocket Soldier<br />Compared to the usual infantry, the movement speed of Rocket Soldiers is quite low; but once they are in range, they're very effective against buildings and armored units like tanks. They are also not limited to ground combat and can attack helicopters or MIGs with their Dragon TOW rockets, playing an important role as a mobile Anti-Aircraft unit.</p><p>Spy<br />Spys are used to obtain information from enemy base structures by infiltrating various buildings like Ore Refineries, Silos, War Factories or Barracks; still they have to beware of Attack Dogs at all time as these are able to detect a Spy and uncover his true identity. Selecting infiltrated buildings displays units currently under construction (War Factories, Barracks etc.) or show current credits (Ore Refineries, Silos).</p><p>Engineer<br />Engineers are able to capture low-health enemy buildings or instantly bring heavily-damaged buildings up to full health in their own base. With the lowest movement speed of all ground troops, they should always be protected by other units or transported in armored vehicles like APCs to reach their destination.</p><p>Thief<br />Thiefs are used to infiltrate facilities for Ore and credit storage. Once the thief has entered a Refinery or Silo he steals half of the stored credits and transfers them to the Allied account.</p><p>Tanya<br />Tanya is classified as a mercenary elite special unit; she is unarmored, relatively ineffective against tanks or armored units but specialized in elimination of infantry and able to rapidly diminish hostile groups of soldiers. Tanya also has the ability to plant C4 explosives and tear down enemy structures within seconds.</p><p>AT Mine Layer<br />AT Mine Layers are very useful units against vehicles, especially tank armies. Running over these mines usually causes heavy damage and affected units can easily be destroyed with a few subsequent attacks. Once they are empty, Mine Layers can be reloaded on the Service Depot.</p><p>Ore Truck<br />A single Ore Truck belongs to the basic equipment of every Ore Refinery and is deployed after its construction; these trucks have heavy armor, are unarmed and transport the Ore or Gemstones from the fields to the Ore Refinery. Additional Ore Trucks can be deployed in the War Factory for faster mining.</p><p>Ranger<br />Rangers are light armored 4x4's, which are well known for their good maneuverability in sloping and difficult terrain. They are equipped with a M-60 machine gun, therefore efficient against all kinds of infantry and also well suited for scouting missions.</p><p>Light Tank<br />Light Tanks are an essential backbone unit for the Allied army; due to their speed and medium armor, they are highly mobile and display their strengths in large and also smaller divisions, supported by infantry.</p><p>APC<br />Armored Personnel Carriers are used for quick transport of infantry units. They can run over Sandbag barriers and are armed with an automatic machine gun to deal with troops and light armored enemy vehicles.</p><p>Artillery<br />With their strong firepower and firing range, Artillery units support the army from afar and are able to heavily damage buildings and annihilate whole infantry divisions. Still, they only have light armor, move slowly and therefore are at the mercy of the enemy if no extra units are detached for protection.</p><p>Medium Tank<br />Equipped with a 105mm cannon, Medium Tanks have higher damage output than Light Tanks and are also more durable due to their heavy armor. This \"Tank Upgrade\" is well worth it and shows its strengths particularly in larger and mixed divisions with Light Tanks and Artillery.</p><p>Mobile Gap Generator<br />The mobile version of the Gap Generator serves the same purpose like the stationary one. The created shroud size is considerably smaller but still does the trick and hides all units or buildings from the enemy in close proximity.</p><p>MCV<br />With an MCV (Mobile Construction Vehicle), it is possible to rebuild a Construction Yard if it gets destroyed by the enemy. Sometimes it is also a good idea to establish an additional base with an MCV and make it possible to aquire new Ore resources further away.</p><p>Transport Ship<br />For transportation of vehicles and infantry across the the sea Transport Ships can be build. These are relatively lightweight, have a decent ground speed and can be loaded or unloaded with up to 5 units at shore areas.</p><p>Gunboat<br />Gunboats are perfect for initial scouting, submarine detection and elimination. They should always be in motion to evade torpedoes as they only have light armor and are quite slow.</p><p>Destroyer<br />Destroyers are the most universal naval vessel, with their Stinger missiles they are able to attack aircraft as well as land-based units. Additionally they are quipped with 2 depth-charge launchers (Gunboats only have 1) to neutralize Submarines fast and efficiently.</p><p>Cruiser<br />As the strongest Allied unit on the battlefield, Cruisers are equipped with two powerful 8-inch artillery cannons which are able to tear down an enemy base within minutes. An extreme firing range and heavy armor makes even one Cruiser a serious threat. The movement speed and the missing depth-charge launchers are the only weaknesses, thus they need to be protected from Submarines by Gunboats &amp; Destroyers.</p><p>Apache Longbow<br />Longbows are very durable, moderately fast and can stand quite a few shots, making them perfect for continually wearing down enemy base defenses with their missiles or attack support structures like Power Plants or Ore Refineries.</p><p>GPS Satellite<br />Upon complete construction of an Allied Tech Center, a countdown for GPS activation will be started automatically. After expiration a satellite is launched and the whole map will be revealed on the radar, without field of view limitations by the fog of war.</p><p>Sonar Pulse<br />When a Spy enters a Soviet Sub Pen, Sonar Pulse will be available; after activation all Sub Marine locations will be detected and visible on the map.</p><h3><strong>Soviets</strong></h3><p>Construction Yard<br />The Construction Yard is the heart of every base and is needed for proper construction of buildings; equipped with heavy armor, it is very durable but should be protected with excellent defense systems as in case of destruction of a CY no more buildings can be produced.</p><p>Power Plant<br />Power Plants are one of the most important elements in a base ; they supply all buildings with energy and ensure proper function and speed of unit production. If Power Plants get damaged, it is highly recommended to quickly repair them as their power output is directly proportional to their structural condition.</p><p>Advanced Power Plant<br />Advanced Power Plants perform and share the same functions as their smaller counterparts but are thought to mainly supply high-tech structures like Technology Centres, Anti-Air Guns or Gap Generators. These are much more power-intensive and therefore become inoperative if they are running out of energy, so Advanced Power Plants should always be kept in excellent condition.</p><p>Ore Refinery<br />This factory is required for storing and smelting down ore; in this process the ore is converted to in-game credits which can be used for unit and building production. Every Ore Refinery comes with a heavy-armored Ore Truck to harvest the Ore and transport it back to your base. The storage capacity of the Refinery is limited to ore worth 2000$, so Silos have to be built for higher amounts.</p><p>Ore Silo<br />Silos are needed when the Refinery can't hold any more ore. A Silo can store ore worth 1500$ and should be decently guarded as all credits are lost in case of destruction.</p><p>Barracks<br />The Barracks provide a training ground for several light infantry units such as Rifle Soldiers, Grenadiers, Flame Infantry or Engineers. Additionally, in Multiplayer battles also special units like Mechanics are available.</p><p>Kennel<br />The Kennel is required for training and housing of Attack Dogs.</p><p>War Factory<br />War Factories, together with the Barracks, are the backbone of the supply line; they are used for the assembly of light and heavy military vehicles like Tanks, V2 Rocket Launchers or additional Ore Trucks.</p><p>Sub Pen<br />A Sub Pen is needed for production of Submarines &amp; Transport boats. It is also possible to repair these naval units directly at the docks.</p><p>Airfield<br />The Airfield allows construction of MIG and YAK planes, and allows access to Paratroopers, Parachute bombs, as well as Spy Planes. Only one plane is allowed per Airfield that has been constructed. If an in-use Airfield is destroyed while its associated plane is still in the air, the plane will crash.</p><p>Helipad<br />On the Soviet side, Helipads are required for the construction and maintenance of Hind helicopters; again, it's also possible to produce additional helicopters which have to be manually assigned for reloading ammunition if they don't have their own Helipad. Damaged aircraft units can be repaired on the Service Depot.</p><p>Service Depot<br />Damaged vehicles or aircraft units can be placed on the Service Depot and within a short amount of time they are repaired and back to full health. As less credits have to be spent on a service than for buying a new unit a full repair is consequently much more cost-efficient. Also Mine Layers can be reloaded and units can be sold when moved onto the Service Depot.</p><p>Radar Dome<br />After building a Radar Dome an overview of the map for revealed terrain becomes available, which is useful for detecting enemy units and spotting attacks early on. If there is not enough energy available or if Power Plants are in bad condition the Radar Dome will shut down temporarily.</p><p>Technology Center<br />Building a Tech Center requires a lot of energy, but advances the technology level and enables production of higher tier units. Upon complete construction it is possible to build high-tech defense structures like Tesla Coils and powerful units like Mammoth Tanks.</p><p>Flame Tower<br />Heavy-armored Flame Towers are very effective against all kinds of ground units but especially infantry divisions; larger groups mostly don't stand a chance and are burnt to death within 2 or 3 fireball shots.</p><p>Tesla Coil<br />Tesla Coils unleash deadly bolts of lightning at enemy units when they are in range, shocking infantry to death and melting through vehicle steel within seconds. Unfortunately they can not attack aircraft units, so protection with SAM Sites is advised. Destruction of a single Power Plant can render them inoperative as they have an extraordinary high power consumption and will be powered down upon low energy levels.</p><p>SAM Site<br />SAM Sites are a durable base defense against Allied jets or helicopters. They fire long-range missiles and have a relatively high firing rate, making them very effective against slow aircraft.</p><p>Iron Curtain<br />The Iron Curtain was successfully developed as a secret project under leader Stalin; upon activation it is possible to render buildings or single units invulnerable for a short period of time.</p><p>Missile Silo<br />With the construction of a Missile Silo a timer will indicate the ongoing assembly of an atomic warhead; after expiration the missile is ready to be launched. Infantry units close to the point of impact will immediately be eliminated while structures and armored units will be heavily damaged and additionally suffer from radioactive fire.</p><p>Barbed-Wire Barrier<br />The Soviet counterpart to Allied Sandbags; the wire is cheap and reliable for holding back non-tracked vehicles and all kinds of infantry troops. Still, Rocket Soldiers can destroy it with a few shots and tanks easily break through by running over it.</p><p>Concrete Barrier<br />It's always recommended to build Concrete Walls when they are available as these are more durable than Barbed Wire. Armored vehicles like Allied tanks, APCs or Artilleries also can't drive through and have to destroy them beforehand.</p><p>Soviet units</p><p>Attack Dog<br />German sheperds are notorious for their strength and attentiveness; allthough they can be killed easily by machine gun-armed vehicles or units, these dogs can tear apart any infantry unit within seconds and is the only one who can reveal Spies.</p><p>Rifle Infantry<br />Standard Rifle Infantry units are mostly efficient against other infantry and can cope with light armored vehicles when gathered in groups.</p><p>Grenadier<br />Grenadiers may be slower than Riflemen but have a higher range and firepower. Caution is advised when Grenadiers are eliminated; their remaining grenades blow up and damage nearby units, this could setup a deadly chain reaction when they are gathered in groups!</p><p>Flame Infantry<br />These soldiers are specialized on burning down enemy structures and neutralizing slow ground troops; like Grenadiers, they should not stand too close to each other as the reserve tanks on their backs filled with flammable chemicals explode upon death.</p><p>Engineer<br />Engineers are able to capture low-health enemy buildings or instantly bring heavily-damaged buildings up to full health in their own base. With the lowest movement speed of all ground troops they should always be protected by other units or transported in armored vehicles.</p><p>Ore Truck<br />A single Ore Truck belongs to the basic equipment of every Ore Refinery and is deployed after its construction; these trucks have heavy armor, are unarmed and transport the Ore from the fields to the Ore Refinery. Additional Ore Trucks can be deployed in the War Factory for faster mining.</p><p>Heavy Tank<br />The standard Heavy Tank of the Soviets is nearly twice as powerful as the Allied counterpart, the Medium Tank. With two 105mm cannons it can be considered a serious threat for every enemy vehicle or structure. Aside from a more expensive cost price, the high firepower of the two cannons also result in slower vehicle speed and firing rate.</p><p>AP Mine Layer<br />The Anti-Personnel Mine Layer can help to keep larger infantry divisions in check; like the Allied AP Mine Layer it can place 5 mines before it has to be reloaded on the Service Depot.</p><p>V2 Rocket Launcher<br />Equipped with long-range V2 rockets, this sweet piece is feared among its enemies; both stationary and slow moving units as well as buildings like Power Plants or Weapons Factories are primary targets as most of these can be destroyed with two or three shots. Nonetheless the V2 Rocket Launcher also has a very long reloading time, so it should be protected at all times.</p><p>Mobile Radar Jammer<br />The Mobile Radar Jammer (MRJ) is only available in Multiplayer Mode and can be used to disrupt and disturb enemy radar signals.</p><p>Mammoth Tank<br />Despite their lack of speed, Mammoth Tanks are the most powerful tank type available. By using their two 120mm cannons for attacks on vehicles or structures and short-range missiles against infantry and aircraft, even a small division of these giants can destroy an entire base within a short amount of time. Additionally, heavily damaged Mammoth Tanks will get slowly auto-repaired to half of their max health when they are not attacked.</p><p>MCV<br />With an MCV (Mobile Construction Vehicle), it is possible to rebuild a Construction Yard if it gets destroyed by the enemy. Sometimes it is also a good idea to establish an additional base with an MCV and make it possible to aquire new Ore resources further away.</p><p>Transport Ship<br />For transportation of vehicles and infantry across the the sea Transport Ships can be build. These are relatively lightweight, have a decent ground speed and can be loaded or unloaded with up to 5 units at shore areas.</p><p>Submarine<br />Aside from Transport Ships, Submarines are the only naval unit on the Soviet side; Submarine torpedoes have a high attack range, they can heavily damage or eliminate Allied Gunboats and Destroyers from far away before they even get close enough to return fire. Damaged Submarines tend to surface more often, making them more vulnerable for subsequent attacks.</p><p>YAK<br />YAKs appear to be a more advanced version of the famous \"Red Baron\", perfectly suited for fights against small and also larger infantry groups and light armored structures. Still, their low speed makes them vulnerable to Rocket Soldiers and Anti-Aircraft Guns.</p><p>Badger Bomber<br />Badger Bombers are used for transportation of paratroopers and parachute bombs to a target area.</p><p>Paratroopers<br />Upon successful selection of a target location, five Paratroopers will be dropped by a Badger Bomber as a reinforcement.</p><p>Parachute Bombs<br />Allthough Parachute Bombs easily decimate or heavily damage mixed divisions of infantry and vehicles, targeting is pretty difficult and dropping of these bombs can be quite imprecise as they are scattered in a certain area.</p><p>Spy Planes<br />Spy Planes are responsible for recon flights to remove the fog of war and therefore provide great assistance with revealing parts of the map in periodic intervals.</p><p>MIG<br />Fast airspeed, high maneuverability and the uncontested firepower of their heat-seeking missiles made the MIG the most powerful unit of the Soviet aircraft fleet; a formation of several MIGs can destroy various structures or vehicles instantly, unless there are Anti-Aircraft nearby which can cause serious trouble.</p><p>Hind Helicopter<br />Hind Helicopters are very durable, but quite slow and unable to consistently attack moving targets. They are less effective than MIGs and show their strength only against infantry, unprotected structures and slow moving Artillery units.</p><p>Transport Helicopter*<br />Similar to APCs or Transport Boats, this helicopter can be used for transportation of up to 5 infantry units in Multiplayer Mode.</p>",

With no voice acting of any kind, the game shows the story in a simplistic (and often comical) form.</p><p>As the game is geared towards family-friendly play, the game uses simplistic <a href=\"/hack-and-slash/3015-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-469\">hack-and-slash</a> action (with support for two-player co-operative gameplay), with players manipulating the environment (using <a href=\"/the-force/3015-172/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-172\">the Force</a>) and switching between characters to solve puzzles. Throughout the game, players collect <a href=\"/lego-stud/3055-2481/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2481\">LEGO Studs</a>, which can be used to purchase bonus content (including new characters for use in \"Free Play\" mode). The game does not make use of a <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a> system (and thus there are <a href=\"/impossible-to-lose/3015-6762/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6762\">no Game Over scenarios</a>), with each \"death\" causing the player to lose some Studs. In addition, the game features occasional vehicular sequences (such as podracing and space combat).</p><p>Along with <a href=\"/lego-star-wars/3025-449/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-449\">numerous sequels</a>, Traveller's Tales made numerous games with the <a href=\"/lego/3025-448/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-448\">LEGO</a> franchise (particularly with licensed games, including <a href=\"/lego-batman/3025-2180/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2180\">LEGO Batman</a>, <a href=\"/lego-marvel/3025-4075/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-4075\">LEGO Marvel</a>, <a href=\"/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings/3030-38282/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38282\">LEGO Lord of the Rings</a>, and <a href=\"/lego-harry-potter/3025-2097/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2097\">LEGO Harry Potter</a>). Most of these games use a similar action-adventure gameplay. An enhanced version of the game, combined with <a href=\"/lego-star-wars-ii-the-original-trilogy/3030-9631/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9631\">LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy</a>, was released in 2007 as <a href=\"/lego-star-wars-the-complete-saga/3030-11120/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11120\">LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga</a>.</p><p>The game also received a handheld version for the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, developed by <a href=\"/griptonite-games/3010-377/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-377\">Griptonite</a> and published on March 29, 2005. Unlike the main game, this version is played in <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric perspective</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Mechanically, the game is an extremely simple hack and slash game presented in <a href=\"/polygonal-3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">three dimensional</a> levels, with light platforming elements. There are fifty-six playable characters in the game, (most of which are only playable in the Free Play mode), however they are all divided into four archetypes - Jedi, Blaster, Super Jump, Droid. Jedi characters can use the force to solve some simplistic <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzles</a> and deflect enemy <a href=\"/blaster/3055-478/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-478\">blaster</a> fire; Blaster characters can shoot enemies with their blaster and possess a <a href=\"/grapple/3055-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-5\">grappling hook</a>; <a href=\"/super-jump/3015-694/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-694\">Super jump</a> characters possess the ability to jump much higher than other characters, and <a href=\"/robots/3015-278/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-278\">droid</a> characters do not get intentionally fired at by enemies, whilst possessing the ability to unlock certain doors.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/434423-lego_star_wars___the_video_game__usa__europe___en_fr_de_es_it_nl_da__07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-434423\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8572/434423-lego_star_wars___the_video_game__usa__europe___en_fr_de_es_it_nl_da__07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-434423\"><img alt=\"In game cutscenes add humor and life to ordinarily static Legos.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8572/434423-lego_star_wars___the_video_game__usa__europe___en_fr_de_es_it_nl_da__07.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8572/434423-lego_star_wars___the_video_game__usa__europe___en_fr_de_es_it_nl_da__07.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></a><figcaption>In game cutscenes add humor and life to ordinarily static Legos.</figcaption></figure><p>As players progress through the \" <a href=\"/campaign/3015-4011/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4011\">Story Mode</a>\", they recap the events of the New Star Wars Trilogy. This consists mainly of the <a href=\"/hack-and-slash/3015-469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-469\">Hack and Slash</a>/Platforming gameplay, with occasional vehicular sections (for example, the large space battle featured in the opening to Episode III) breaking up the action. After a scenario has been completed, the player may enter this scenario in \"free play\" mode, which allows them to select any character for use in any stage of the game, including secret characters that have been unlocked. This allows various character special abilities to be used, opening the way to various secret areas not available in the story mode.</p><p>As the game goes on, players accumulate \"studs\", the currency in the game.

In order to race the driver, you must pull up behind them and flash your lights, triggering a race. In order to win the race, you must bring their health bar down. Bringing their health bar down could be achieved either by making them crash, or taking the lead, with a bigger lead resulting in the bar dropping more quickly. Upon defeating every driver in a gang, the gang's \"boss\" will appear. Upon beating any driver, you unlock their car. Once you defeat every driver on the map, the next gang(s) appears.<br /><br />There are also independent drivers on the map, whose appears can depend on many factors, such as odometer on the car currently driving, the PS2's internal clock, how many drivers you've beaten, and how much money you have.<br /><br />There are no licensed cars in Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero.<br /></p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2 (which can be translated to \"Burn Hot Rhythm Soul Go! Fight! Cheer Squad 2\") is the sequel to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> original, <a href=\"/osu-tatakae-ouendan/3030-7037/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7037\">Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</a> which was released in Japan in 2005. The game follows a group of superhero male Japanese <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cheerleader/3015-1159/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1159\">cheerleaders</a>, known as Ouendan, who travel all across Japan (and even outer space) to solve various people's problems through song and dance. The new twist for the second entry in the Japanese series is the presence of rival Ouendan, whom are playable in half of the game's stages.</p><h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As in the original game, the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/yuuhi-town/3035-4491/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4491\">Yuuhi Town</a> Ouendan come to the aid of locals in need, firing them up and cheering them on in order to give them the will to succeed. However, a rival ouendan known as the Encouraging Nobility appear on the scene, causing a rivalry to stir. The two ouendan squads continue aiding the townsfolk separately until once again, the entire world is threatened by an apocalyptic event; the threat of the sun's death and the freezing of Earth. When things become truly dire, the rival squads team up to cheer on the world, and with their collective spirit, reignite the sun.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The gameplay in Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2 is exactly the same as both Ouendan, and <a href=\"/elite-beat-agents/3030-11982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11982\">Elite Beat Agents</a> before it. Using the Nintendo DS stylus, the player taps out the rhythm of the song playing.</p><h3>Hit Markers</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Circular, numbered icons that appear on the touch screen during play are called \"Hit Markers\". Each marker in a sequence must be tapped in numerical order. To assist in timing, rings close around each marker. As the ring lines up with the edge of the circle, the player taps the marker to match the song's rhythm. Based on the player's accuracy, each individual marker is worth 50, 100, or 300 points. Missing a marker entirely reduces the player's health meter. The player can eventually unlock the ability to play the game without the use of the guide circles for extra challenge.</p><h3>Phrase Markers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10727/352513-oeundan_2_moero_nekketsu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-352513\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.5131578947368\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10727/352513-oeundan_2_moero_nekketsu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-352513\"><img alt=\"Phrase Marker\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10727/352513-oeundan_2_moero_nekketsu.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/10727/352513-oeundan_2_moero_nekketsu.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" data-width=\"228\"></a><figcaption>Phrase Marker</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"Phrase Markers\" are essentially Hit Markers with tracks that extend from them. The player must tap the marker with the stylus and then hold it to the screen while following a ball that rolls along the track to the other end. Small dots line the path, and points are tallied for each dot the player essentially collects on the track. Some Phrase Markers display an arrow on the other end of of the track, indicating that the player must reverse direction.</p><h3>Spin Markers</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"Spin Markers\" appear at key points of songs. Essentially a giant wheel, the player must spin it as fast as they can to fill a gauge before a circle closes in on the wheel's axel. Spinning more than is required yields bonus points.</p><h3>Health</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"Health\" is represented by a bar at the top of the touch screen. The bar is divided into red and yellow sections; if the player's health is in the yellow during a song checkpoint, then that particular portion of the song is considered \"passed\". The gauge constantly depletes and must be filled by hitting markers successfully. The more accurate the player is, the more the gauge will be filled. If a marker is missed, a chunk of the meter will be docked. If the meter depletes entirely, the level is failed, and the stage's client will hit rock bottom.</p><h2>Elite Beat Agents Bonus</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While Ouendan 2 is the sequel to the original Japanese Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, a western spin-off, <a href=\"/elite-beat-agents/3030-11982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11982\">Elite Beat Agents</a>, was released in between them. Elite Beat Agents, which was not released in Japan, features new heroes that resemble secret agents rather than cheerleaders. The game's characters, dilemmas, storylines, and soundtrack were all tailored for a western demographic, but in terms of gameplay is identical to the Ouendan titles.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For a limited time in 2007, people that bought Ouendan 2 could take the game to Japanese stores equipped with DS download stations and download data to unlock EBA character skins for use in the game. The EBA characters use the same dance/cheer animations as the Japanese characters with some very slight variations.</p><h2>Song List</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In order of unlocking:</p><ol><li>Sukima Switch - \"Zenryoku Shōnen\"</li><li>Kaela Kimura - \"Rirura Riruha\"</li><li>FLOW - \"Okuru Kotoba\"</li><li>Ken Hirai - \"Pop Star\"</li><li>Hitomi Yaida - \"Go my way\"</li><li>The Checkers - \"Julia ni Heartbreak\"</li><li>Going Under Ground - \"VISTA\"</li><li>Home Made Kazoku - \"Shōnen Heart\"</li><li>mihimaru GT - \"Kibun Jōjō ↑↑\"</li><li>Tomoyasu Hotei - \"Bambina\"</li><li>SMAP - \"Bang!

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Tales of Phantasia is a real-time action RPG and the first game in the long-running <a href=\"/tales/3025-613/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-613\">Tales</a> franchise. One of the bigger games on the Super Famicom, coming in at 48 megabits, Phantasia was an unusually sophisticated Super Famicom game thanks in part to <a href=\"/hiroya-hatsushiba/3040-65730/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-65730\">Hiroya Hatsushiba</a>'s \"Flexible Voice Driver,\" which allowed extensive (for the time) voice acting and a full pop song opening, Yoshida Yukari's \"Yume wa Owaranai,\" on a home console. Famed manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima's character designs would further cement the series' <a href=\"/anime-games/3015-765/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-765\">anime</a> aesthetic. Aside from this, it was also the progenitor of the Linear Motion Battle System and much of the series' staple items, skills, and pantheon of Summon Creatures that continue to be expanded upon. This has caused some confusion much in the way <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> has with its recurring themes and names, though as of now only <a href=\"/tales-of-phantasia-narikiri-dungeon/3030-25907/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25907\">Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon</a>, <a href=\"/tales-of-symphonia/3030-21237/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21237\">Tales of Symphonia</a>, and <a href=\"/tales-of-symphonia-dawn-of-the-new-world/3030-21073/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21073\">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a> are known to connect to Phantasia's 'Aselia' timeline.</p><p>Phantasia has enjoyed a Tales record of four <a href=\"/remake/3015-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\">re-releases</a>. These include an enhanced remake on <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>, a hybrid SNES/PSX version on <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">GBA</a> with some added events, and two releases on <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> that upgraded <a href=\"/sprite/3015-491/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-491\">sprite</a> detail, added substantial amounts of voice acting (hence the name \"Full-Voice Edition\"), and included the GBA exclusive sub-events. The 2nd PSP release, Tales of Phantasia X (pronounced \"Cross\"), part of <a href=\"/tales-of-phantasia-narikiri-dungeon-x/3030-30419/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30419\">Narikiri Dungeon X</a>, refines the formula further. While the GBA version and an anime adaptation are the only ones to be officially localized into English, many fan translation groups have attempted to patch various versions with English text. Most notable of these was DeJap's release of the SFC version in 2001.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/536516-talesof__6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-536516\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/536516-talesof__6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-536516\"><img alt=\"The Sealing of Dhaos.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/536516-talesof__6_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/536516-talesof__6_.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></a><figcaption>The Sealing of Dhaos.</figcaption></figure><p>100 years ago, four warriors fought and sealed away an Evil King that had been terrorizing humanity. Unaware of this conflict and his family's ties to it, <a href=\"/cless-alvein/3005-2787/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2787\">Cless Alvein</a> lives a simple life in the village of Toltus as a hunter of local game and apprentice to his father, Alvein Sword Style Master Miguel Alvein. He sets off on an ordinary hunt alongside his childhood friend, <a href=\"/chester-burklight/3005-3132/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3132\">Chester Barklight</a>, but is soon sent racing back by the sound of the village's warning bell. Thunder began to roll as a horrifying sight greeted them: the villagers had all been slaughtered, including Miguel and Maria Alvein and Chester's little sister Ami. His mother's dying words pleaded Cless to flee with the pendant he had been entrusted with before the marauders returned. Though initially only set on revenge against the ones responsible, the two would find themselves thrust into a complex conflict spanning time and space.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p><a href=\"/cless-alvein/3005-2787/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2787\"><b>Cless Alvein</b></a> - The prototypical swordsman and first line of defense for the party, Cless is a skilled and resourceful fighter, able to incorporate swords, axes and spears along with shields into his techniques. He is upright and disciplined, often looking out for others, but he can be a little naive. Though not dense by any means, Cless tends to comically fumble his way through dungeons and puzzles. He also has a love of horrible puns and wordplay. When it comes to Dhaos, however, his hatred borders on fanaticism.</p><p><b><a href=\"/chester-burklight/3005-3132/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3132\">Chester Barklight</a></b> - Chester is the Legolas to Cless's Aragorn, dishing out pain from afar with his trusty bow. Although hotheaded and bitter over his loss, he sees the need to be upbeat when Cless can't be. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in harm's way for his friend, who he feels is far more capable than himself. Chester tries not to sweat the small stuff too much. His aim and drive to improve are second to none.</p><p><a href=\"/mint-adnade/3005-4938/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4938\"><b>Mint Adnade</b></a> - Cless finds Mint trapped in Euclid's prison when he himself is captured by the \"Man in Black Armor.\" He comes to find she's also related to one of the four heroes and was holding a similar pendant before it was stolen. Mint is the healer of the group and a faithful priestess. Her only offensive spells are debuffs and 'Pikohan', strange toy hammers that fall from the sky and stun enemies. Although she's very proper and ladylike, Mint can also be romantic and impulsive when it comes to subjects like love and matchmaking and isn't afraid to express her opinion. She has a love of piano and plays proficiently.</p><p><a href=\"/claus-f-lester/3005-10537/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10537\"><b>Klarth F. Lester</b></a> - Cless and Mint meet Klarth 100 years in the past in a substantially quieter Euclid Village. He has been researching ways in which humans could use magic like elves and half-elves do with his partner, Mirald. It's Mirald who finally convinces Klarth to go along with the two without payment, as their goals are basically the same: the party needs magic to combat Dhaos and Klarth needs to travel to form pacts with Summons through the use of rare Pact Rings. He can be selfish and crude at times, but his knowledge, wisdom and Summons make him invaluable. His pinup collection is infamous.</p><p><a href=\"/arche-klein/3005-4138/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4138\"><b>Arche Klaine</b></a> - Arche is a mischievous half-elf who rides a broom and casts spells that make enemies go boom. Once her identity is revealed, her father Bart of Lone Valley gives her permission to journey with the group and use her magic to take down Dhaos. Arche is bright and cheery and even a little boy crazy, but she shows moments of weakness and frustration when it comes to the poor treatment of half-elves and her missing Elven mother. Her cooking can be fatal.</p><p><a href=\"/suzu-fujibayashi/3005-10536/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10536\"><b>Suzu Fujibayashi</b></a> - This little <a href=\"/kunoichi/3015-4596/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4596\"><b>kunoichi</b></a> (female ninja) hails from the mysterious hidden Ninja Village. Suzu is the granddaughter of the village chief and next in line after her parents. Despite her small stature and young age, she's deadly serious and determined to master Igaguri Ninja Arts. Although she does her best to mask her emotions, she has a bit of a crush on Cless and a monster sweet tooth. She was originally an <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\"><b>NPC</b></a> in the SFC version, but can be recruited in all subsequent releases if her sidequest is completed.</p><p><a href=\"/dhaos/3005-8603/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8603\"><b>Dhaos</b></a> - Dhaos is his name, Dhaos Laser is his game. Little is known about his actual motives, but the party nevertheless sets out to stop his evil machinations. He has an odd attachment to the Mana Tree Yggdrasil and its guardian, Martel...</p><p>(All names are based on Japanese documentation.)</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1397985\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56822810590631\" data-width=\"491\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 491px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1397985\"><img alt=\"Fight a Slime in Real-Time\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg 491w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/30194/1397985-top_psp.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Fight a Slime in Real-Time</figcaption></figure><p>Battles take place in real-time on a 2D plane that characters can freely move on, much like that of a classic 2D fighting game, except button inputs are limited to whichever button is selected for skills up, down, left or right, or without a direction on the D-Pad for a total of 4 skills or spells that can be set, not counting shortcuts. Using skills or casting spells costs the character TP, or Technical Points, which can be replenished with items, food, sleeping, or slightly when a battle ends. There is a slight exception to this, as there is an item that allows Cless to perform any move without the use of TP if the proper input is performed. This is also how Cless uses <a href=\"/stan/3005-3138/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3138\">Stahn</a>'s Satsugeki Bukouken with Stahn's sword, Dymlos.</p><p>Also introduced for the first time in the PlayStation version of Phantasia was the Mystic Arte, a desperation move Cless can use if he equips the right Title and holds Guard, Skill and Attack during a combination move when his HP is low enough. Some of the older SFC concepts such as range affecting which skills you could use and Cless being the only playable character were abandoned, but the stopping of time when a spell is performed has pervaded in every release of Phantasia. Combat as a whole is somewhat slower paced than later games in the series, but the core concepts continue to shape the ever progressing <a href=\"/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-219\">LMBS System</a>.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/motoi-sakuraba/3040-65731/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-65731\">Motoi Sakuraba</a>, the game's most prominent composer, makes a cameo appearance in Alvanista's guild bar as a pianist named Sakuraba, who plays a song for the party. The real Sakuraba is himself a keyboardist.</li><li>Similarly, Yomi, the songstress that sings the PSX and PSP opening can be found in Alvanista Castle under certain conditions.</li><li>Even in the international versions of the game where the opening song was removed, Yume wa Owaranai can be heard \"sung\" by a dog in a house in Euclid City.</li><li>Sleeping in Miguel Village at certain points in the PSX version and beyond will net the player scenes with Chester that level him up significantly closer to the rest of the party. Another one with Cless involves defeating the members of the Miguel Sword Fighting School and then sleeping in the same inn. Cless dreams of his father and is then able to use the ultimate Alvein Style desperation attack.</li><li>Stan's sister <a href=\"/lilith-aileron/3005-10545/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10545\">Lilith</a> from <a href=\"/tales-of-destiny/3030-1335/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1335\">Tales of Destiny</a> makes a cameo appearance in the Euclid Arena as a secret boss in the PSX and PSP versions. If Cless wins, he gets Stahn's sword Dymlos, which allows Cless to use Satsugeki Bukouken when he reaches level 100.</li><li><a href=\"/odin/3005-1778/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1778\">Odin</a>'s <a href=\"/valkyrie/3015-1677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1677\">Valkyrie</a> is a cameo character from another Namco game in which she stars, <a href=\"/legend-of-valkyrie/3030-17440/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17440\">Legend of Valkyrie</a>. She moonlights in many Tales games.</li><li>They player can reacquire Odin's spear Gungnir with boosted stats and a fabulous new color if you defeat him in the future at Odin's Tower.</li><li>In the sunken city Thor, interact with the projection TV and under the Game Channel to play Groovy Arche, a fun little <a href=\"/gradius/3025-261/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-261\">Gradius</a>-esque <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game</a> starring Arche.

In the course of the game you become involved with murder, revenge, the occult, daemonic possession and other horrors that should have died a long time ago. You will discover many of the awful things that lurk behind a seemingly humdrum existence, and learn through bitter experience that ignorance really can be bliss.<br/><br/>The Hound of Shadow uses the Timeline role-playing system to create a Cthulhu Mythos story, inspired by the works of H.

      "description": "<h2>Overview <br/></h2>Grandia III is an RPG for the PS2 made in 2006. The Gameplay was very similar to past Grandia games with the battle system's fastest-character-goes-first, wheel turn-based gameplay.<br/><br/><h2>Story <br/></h2>You follow Yuki, a young boy who wants to be a pilot , who gets mixed into saving 2 worlds when he meets a \"communicator\" called Alfina. Alfina is being chased by her brother and his companions, an incompetent brute Kornell, the wicked yet beautiful Violetta, and La-Illim, an undead monster who summons undead dragons to fight for him. On his adventures Yuki makes invaluable friends, Ulf, a dragon rider who shares his love of the sky, Alfonso, the powerful fisherman who believes in dreams, Hect, a silent, almost lifeless girl, Miranda, Yuki's mother and a great cook and finally Dahna a tribe leader and fortune-teller. Together they travel around the world attempting to stop the evil Xorn and protect the Guardian spirits before Emelious destroys them all.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay <br/></h2>Special gameplay elements include a multitude of equipment including \"mana eggs\" which increase magical potency according to elements. Powerful spells can be extracted from mana eggs. Each character has different skill sets for you to learn and level up.  <br/> <br/>The main form of transportation in the game is by plane.<br/> <br/><h2>Music<br/></h2>Noriyuki Iwadare, who composed all prior installments of the Grandia series, returns. The game features the theme song \"In the Sky\" by Japanese recording artist Miz.",

Released in 2005 on the Xbox and a year later on the PC and MAC. The game featured a variety of gameplay genres and subverted mix of themes in a retro-futuristic setting. At times the game <a href=\"/breaking-the-fourth-wall/3015-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-138\">breaks the 4th wall</a> as Stubbs will turn and acknowledge the gamer.</p><p>A separate soundtrack was also released, featuring 1950's-era rock 'n' roll and doo-wop songs covered by more 'contemporary artists' (at the time).</p><h2>Story</h2><p>It was 1933, <a href=\"/stubbs/3005-2051/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2051\">Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield</a> was a down-on-his-luck traveling salesman during the Great Depression. When he comes across Knobb Cheese Farm and the family home to the Mondays, Stubbs meets Maggie, daughter of Ottis Monday; a confederate uniform wearing redneck conservative with a <a href=\"/double-barreled-shotgun/3055-655/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-655\">double-barrel shotgun</a> and head of the Quaker State Irregulars. Stubbs and Maggie have a short-lived romantic fling, before her father unloads a shotgun into Stubbs and buries him in an unmarked grave in the Pennsylvania countryside.</p><p>Awoken 26 years later in 1959, Stubbs finds himself in the <a href=\"/utopian-civilization/3015-1716/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1716\">'futuristic utopia'</a> of Punchbowl, Pennsylvania. The brainchild of billionaire playboy industrialist Andrew Monday. Punchbowl is a wonderland of technology; hovering cars, <a href=\"/robots/3015-278/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-278\">robot servants</a> and biodomes. Stubbs also just happened to be reborn on the inaugural opening to the public. He doesn't know where he is, or remembers who killed him, or why. The only thing that he's certain is his new abilities and appetites. The down-on-his-lucksalesman has now been reborn as a <a href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-79\">brain-eatting zombie</a>.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p><strong>Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield:</strong> a once traveling sales who was murdered and mysteriously turned into a zombie with powerful abilities.</p><p><strong>Andr</strong><strong>ew Monday:</strong> son of Maggie, Andrew is the visionary of the technologically advanced city of Punchbowl and head of Monday Industries and \"all round good guy\" (supposedly).</p><p><strong>Maggie Monday:</strong> a once poor white trash daughter to glamorous fashion model, Maggie is now the face and voice of Monday Industries.</p><p><strong>Dr. Wye</strong>: Germany's best scientist and inventor, head of R&amp;D at Monday Industries responsible for bringing Andrew Monday's ideas to fruition. He also has a personal jet pack!</p><p><strong>Police Chief T.S. Masters:</strong> once a famous crime fighter, Masters now serves as Punchbowl's Chief of Police.</p><p><strong>Ottis Monday:</strong> the father of Maggie, grandfather to Andrew and murderer of Edward Stubblefield.

Some are passive that occur contextually or automatically such as the ability to run or breaking down doors.

By eating the brains of his living enemies they will become zombies. The zombie horde can also kill and make more zombies as well. The zombie horde is best used to attack in mass and distract more heavily armed opponents.</p><ul><li><strong>Zombie Strength:</strong> Able to smash down windows and doors. Also able to tear an arm off the living and use it as a club.</li><li><strong>Zombie Sprint</strong><strong>:</strong> Run in one direction long enough and he'll break into zombie sprint.</li><li>T<strong>he Hand:</strong> The left-hand can be detached, thrown and used as a wholly independent entity. If lost or destroyed Stubbs can grow another.

It uses the same concept as <a href=\"/samegame/3015-7633/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7633\">SameGame</a>, where the player clicks on a tile to remove it and any adjacent tiles of the same color, as well as same-colored tiles adjacent to those, and so on. It features both one-player and two-player options.</p><p>The player selects any one of the Sailor Senshi (minus Saturn) or Tuxedo Kamen (Tuxedo Mask). Using the Luna/Artemis heads as cursors, the player \"pops\" clusters of similarly-colored hearts. </p><p>An aspect that Kurukkurin introduces are the sky-blue hearts, which act as \"trash\" in that they will be destroyed along with any tiles that are activated near them, but the player can also \"reveal\" them by passing their cursor across, revealing their color and/or whether they are a useful power-up item. New sky-blue hearts appear regularly while playing, and it's down to the player to either they want to see what they are or simply remove them as-is via chain reactions.</p><p>Aside from the hearts, the game also features various items with different abilities:</p><ul><li>Crossbows, which, when \"popped\", remove all hearts in the direction they face on both sides of the screen.</li><li>Heart Wands will use the player's senshi's elemental power on the opponent's side of the screen.</li><li>Mini Professor Tomoe faces can hatch from greenish, cocoon-like objects, and will destroy any talismans they come in contact with. If the player has any on their side of the screen, however, using a Heart Wand will destroy them instead of hindering the opponent.</li><li>Heart Brooches can remove all hearts of any color of the player's choosing on their side of the screen.</li><li>There are also pink gems that have different effects based on which color heart is selected after them.</li></ul><p>The Senshi-specific powers are as follows:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/sailor-moon/3005-3998/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3998\">Sailor Moon</a> - Destroys a 3x3 block of hearts/items on the opponent's side.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-mercury/3005-13041/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13041\">Sailor Mercury</a> - Floods the opponent's side and makes them unable to turn over white hearts for a period of time.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-mars/3005-13040/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13040\">Sailor Mars</a> - Burns a few random hearts/items on the opponent's side.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-jupiter/3005-13043/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13043\">Sailor Jupiter</a> - Electrifies a few random hearts on the opponent's side.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-venus/3005-13042/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13042\">Sailor Venus</a> - Removes items from the opponent's side.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-uranus/3005-13045/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13045\">Sailor Uranus</a> - Destroys one column on the opponent's side and clears it for a period of time.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-neptune/3005-13046/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13046\">Sailor Neptune</a> - Floods the opponent's side and makes white hearts stop falling in for a period of time.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-pluto/3005-13047/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13047\">Sailor Pluto</a> - Moves the center line over, decreasing the opponent's side by one column.</li><li><a href=\"/sailor-chibi-moon/3005-16980/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16980\">Sailor Chibi Moon</a> - Puts an umbrella in place of an opponent's heart, preventing that column from dropping down for a period of time.</li><li>Tuxedo Kamen - Stands in front of the opponent's side for a period of time.</li></ul>",

The goal of each case, of course, is to find the culprit and discover the truth as led by the evidence. To solve the case, the player has a handful of crime scene investigation tools (i.e. rubber gloves to collect basic, big pieces of evidence, tweezers for bullets found in walls from gun fights and fingerprint powder for, if you haven't already figured it out, collecting fingerprints.) at his disposal. If the player gets somehow stuck in a case, there's always going to be the partner to come and ask for some advice. Each case the player gets a new partner, eventually getting to see and ''work'' with every main character from CSI: Vegas. At the end of each case, the player gets an evaluation score based on how well he's collected and followed evidence and if the player has asked any advice to his partner.</p><p>The voice acting is done by the show's original cast with exceptions of Catherine's and Sara's characters who are voiced by Edie Mirman and Kate Savage respectively.</p><h2>CSI Crew</h2><p>For each case you undertake you'll be backed up by another CSI member who will help you asses the crime scenes, interview witness, and offer their insights into the evidence.

It was well received thanks to its interesting story, likable cast of characters, varied gameplay, and intriguing puzzles. The game takes place in a land called Weyard, where a group of people called adepts have the power to channel the elements of Earth (Venus ), Fire (Mars), Water (Mercury), and Wind (Jupiter). The game centers around two boys named Isaac and Garet who are attempting to stop two fire Adepts named Saturos and Menardi from lighting the four elemental lighthouses that will change Weyard forever. Along the way they meet a Jupiter Adept named Ivan, and a Mercury Adept named Mia.</p><p>It was followed by a sequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4277\" href=\"/golden-sun-the-lost-age/3030-4277/\">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a> on April 14, 2003, which picks up right where the original Golden Sun left off and let players carry over their character data and items via system link or a password. A third game in the series Golden Sun: Dark Down came out in 2010 for the Nintendo DS.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/396097-gfs_44139_2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-396097\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/396097-gfs_44139_2_7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-396097\"><img alt=\"Ragnarok - One of the game's many spells\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396097-gfs_44139_2_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396097-gfs_44139_2_7.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></a><figcaption>Ragnarok - One of the game's many spells</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most prominent features of the game is its nonstandard take on the RPG mechanic of magic, in this game called Psynergy, which can be used inside of battle to deal damage, buff allies, or inflict various statuses on enemies , but can also be used outside of battle to help solve the game's various puzzles by moving pillars, using gusts of wind to clear away leaves, or even freezing a puddle of water to create a temporary pillar.</p><p>The game also featured a creature collection mechanic popular in video games at the time. Early on the Djinn, small magical creatures who are tied to the individual elements, are introduced. These Djinn could be obtained by encountering them in the wild, in towns, or in dungeons and more often than not required you to fight them in order to win them over. The Djinn system became the basis for the game's class mechanic as well and is one of the most deceptively deep systems in recent memory.</p><p>Golden Sun featured an offline versus mode in which two Gameboy Advances were hooked up via link cable where players could use the parties from their own cartridges to battle each other. The game also included a battle arena where you could test your mettle against various enemies using the party you had faced in the main story mode.</p><h2><b>Story</b></h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-396269\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-396269\"><img alt=\"A Boss Battle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Boss Battle\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8812/396269-gfs_44139_2_13.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Boss Battle</figcaption></figure><p>The game starts out in a town called Vale 3 years before the actual adventure.

A storm has erupted, and a boulder from Mt. Aleph is about to fall down and crush the town. Isaac's father and many other villagers go to stop the boulder. Isaac and Garret are sent to the plaza at the bottom of the village initially to meet up with Jenna, looking for help rescuing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3616\" href=\"/felix/3005-3616/\">Felix</a>, her trapped brother in the river. However, on returning with her, the boulder falls, crushing all the villagers that were trying to stop it, including Isaac's father and Jenna's family. Before Isaac and Garret can reach the Plaza, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3428\" href=\"/saturos/3005-3428/\">Saturos</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3429\" href=\"/menardi/3005-3429/\">Menardi</a> find them and attack them. Isaac and Garret are left unconscious but are found by their family and taken to the plaza.</p><h3>Characters</h3><p>There are five party members you will meet on your journey.

The goal of the game is to bring a giant bell back to the castle gates by ordering soldiers through the Gamecube microphone.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598784\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-598784\"><img alt=\"Plot!\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg 720w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14097/598784-o25.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Plot!</figcaption></figure><p>Feudal Japan, 1539. <a data-ref-id=\"3035-37\" href=\"/japan/3035-37/\">Japan</a> is divided by war and its leader, Yamanouchi Nobutada, is surrounded by conspiracy. He believes that one of his most loyal followers is about to betray and murder him. Instead of waiting for the betrayal, he decides to commit suicide. Extremely enraged by the death of his father, Yamanouchi Kagetora, decides to wage war against all the lords of Japan. He believes that he has an edge over his enemies: he thinks the Gods are on his side and summons the Gods who give him the Odama, a giant rolling ball and prized possession of the Kagetora family brought back from China during the Tang dynasty. However, the ball can only be activated by ringing the Ninten bell, a mystical bell that symbolizes God's voice. Yamanouchi wishes to bring the bell back to his castle and become the only ruler of Japan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Odama is a real-time strategy game disguised as a pinball game. Each match starts with a set amount of troops that are sent on to the pinball table. The player controls the flippers and tries to destroy the enemy's defenses by knocking the Odama into things. Each table has different mechanisms that can be triggered such as bridges that must be activated so the soldiers can carry the Ninten Bell over a river or trigger a trap for enemies.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/2073220-odama_game_cube_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073220\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.76884422110553\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/2073220-odama_game_cube_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2073220\"><img alt=\"Give orders to your troops.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/2073220-odama_game_cube_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/86760/2073220-odama_game_cube_2.jpg 398w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/86760/2073220-odama_game_cube_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Give orders to your troops.</figcaption></figure><p>Your troops are weak. Their strength depends on their morale and their morale can only be boosted with a steady stream of rice. When two different troops face each other, numbers appear to indicate who will win, this number depends on morals. There must be enough troops to transport the bell in order to complete the level and game over is when all troops are dead or you run out of continues with the Odama ball. Furthermore, you can kill your own troops with the Odama ball (if the ball is moving slowly, the troops will dodge it). The only way to prevent this from happening is by getting a power up which will surround the ball with a green aura, preventing it from killing your own troops while capturing enemy troops and converting them to allies.Your troops are controlled via the GameCube microphone. Troops can understand simple commands such as advance, retreat, execute and other words. If morale is low, the troops will not listen to your orders.</p>",

      "description": "<p>While Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 is the second installment in the GRAW series, it is also the fourth game in the overall Ghost Recon franchise. GRAW2 was published by Ubisoft and released on March 6, 2007. As of April 26, 2007, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 has sold 1 million copies as of April 26, 2007.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Scott Mitchell and his squad continue their effort to stop the rebel uprising in Mexico, which has taken over the Panama Canal. It quickly becomes clear that the rebels have become a much bigger threat than originally thought when it is revealed that the rebellion is in possession of a WMD, and has the means to attack the United States.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in GRAW2 remains very similar to the original GRAW, with the changes being limited mostly to the AI and squad controls. GRAW2 also features Cross Com 2.0, the network that connects the various units in the squad, which allows the Ghost Leader to see from the point-of-view of each of his teammates. The AI squad-mates now actively seek cover and call out enemy positions contextually, using phrases such as \"behind the car,\" or \"under the green roof.\" Their response time has also been increased and new commands have been added. Also added is the MULE, a mobile resupply point. This ground based UAV can be used to refill ammo, change weapons and as a last resort as cover or a recon vehicle.</p><p>It should be noted that the PC version of GRAW2 was independently developed and is not a port of the console version of the game. The PC version features different levels and a higher difficulty, although it shares a similar story.</p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>Shortly after release, the mayor of one of the towns featured in the game released a statement in which he called the game an insult to both mexican citizens and Mexico itself, and requested that any copies of the game sold in Mexico be seized.</p><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><ul><li>The Map \"Nowhere\" from GRAW 1 is available to players who link their Gamertag to their UBI.com account</li></ul><ul><li>More Guns Pack: Adds some guns from the multiplayer into the Quick Mission part of the singleplayer</li></ul><ul><li>Throwback Pack: 7 extra MP maps taken from past Ghost Recon games</li></ul><ul><li>Throwback Pack 2: 7 extra MP maps from past Ghost Recon games and an extra MP game mode, Co-op Exfiltration</li></ul><ul><li>Co-Op Collection: 9 new MP maps (7 from old Ghost Recon games and 2 brand new), a new 5 mission Co-Op campaign and an extra 9 achievements worth a total of 125 points</li></ul><ul><li>Co-Op Collection 2: 9 new MP maps (again, 7 from old Ghost Recon games and 2 brand new) a new 5 mission Co-Op campaign and 8 extra achievements worth 125 points in total.</li></ul><h2>GRAW 2 Legacy Edition</h2><p>A new edition of GRAW 2 has been released titled the Legacy Edition spanning two discs.

You play as two young girls, Marlone and Elvira, who have to study at the Academy of alchemy, make powerful items, and prove to their masters they are worthy to be real alchemists.<br/><br/>The game is a combination of role-playing and simulation. You have to read books and talk to people in order to learn more about items, and then to buy these items or to to find them somewhere. You must combine powerful items in order to impress your teachers. You also develop your characters in a standard RPG fashion. You can equip weapons and armor on them, and fight random enemies in wilderness areas. You gain levels and become stronger the more enemies you fight. The battles are automatic, and you can only assign a general strategy to your characters.</p>",

The game is actually a <a href=\"/tokusatsu/3015-1193/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1193\">tokusatsu</a> \"hero show\", I.E. a stage show with people in costume acting as heroes and villains; such tokusatsu shows were once a popular form of entertainment for children in Japan and generally would feature well-known heroes and villains, such as characters from Kamen Rider. However, based on the appearance of the audience, the \"Wonder Momo\" show seems to be aimed at a slightly different audience. It is being presented at \"Namco Theater\". </p><p>In the game's storyline, Momo is a heroine from space who is fighting the evil \"Phantom Warudemon Army\" (Kaijin Gundan Warudemon\" / 怪人軍団ワルデモン). </p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554747\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-554747\"><img alt=\"A screen cap from the PC Engine version. \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/238/554747-wondermom06_edited_1.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A screen cap from the PC Engine version. </figcaption></figure><p>The player controls Momo with a traditional 8 way joystick or D-pad, in the case of the home ports. Momo can jump and attack with the respective buttons; she can also high jump by holding up and jump and has several attacks at her disposal. Each stage consists of a backdrop against which Momo will fight a variety of enemies; If the player wanders far enough to either the left of right, they will encounter a curtain. After enough enemies are defeated a boss will appear. A whirlwind will also appear at various points; if Momo makes contact with the tornado, she will turn in to Wonder Momo!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Attacks</h3><ul><li>Kick: A standing kick.</li><li>Crouching Kick: No explanation necessary.</li><li>Jumping Kick: A kick... in the air!</li><li>Two-way Kick: This can only be performed if Momo is crouching or jumping; in addition, she must be facing towards the screen, not left or right.</li><li>Wonder Kick: Jump forward and attack. A powerful jumping kick.</li><li>Wonder Ring: As Wonder Momo, Momo comes equipped with a hoop technically termed the \"wonder ring\". She will throw the hoop instead of kick if the attack button is pressed. The hoop will then bounce around until it is caught; then Momo can throw it again, etc. </li></ul><p>There are two bars at the top of the screen, Momo's vitality bar and a \"wonder\" bar. The vitality bar is (obviously) the amount of damage Momo can take from enemies before the player loses a life. The wonder bar is filled slowly by defeating enemies as regular Momo. When Momo becomes Wonder Momo, the wonder bar depletes at a very slow rate. Should the player miss the whirlwind Momo can also turn in to Wonder Momo at any time by facing forward and rapidly pressing the attack button so long as the player has some wonder meter!</p><h3><b> Items</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1684519\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92660550458716\" data-width=\"109\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 109px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1684519\"><img alt=\"A green and yellow capsule. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" data-width=\"109\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg 109w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A green and yellow capsule. \" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/4/44493/1684519-greencapsule.jpg 109w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" data-width=\"109\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A green and yellow capsule. </figcaption></figure><p>There are a few types of items that can be dropped by enemies. </p><ul><li>Red and yellow capsule: This restores some of Momo's vitality. </li><li>Green and yellow capsule: This will only appear when Momo is \"Wonder Momo\".

They can also block, dodge, and dance around the opponent. Punching takes stamina, and as stamina decreases, punches get slower and weaker.

To give the illusion that players are playing against actual opponents, each of the 18 selectable characters are shown from the bust-up (with facial expressions that change as the game plays) and have uniquely scripted text dialogue (including special conversations between certain characters).</p><p>It is also notable for being one of the few non-adventure games to utilize the studio's <a href=\"/sci/3015-1554/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1554\">Sierra Creative Interpreter</a> (SCI) scripting tool, and is considered a <a href=\"/spiritual-successor/3015-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-425\">spiritual successor</a> to the lead designer's earlier game <a href=\"/hi-res-cribbage/3030-31003/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31003\">Hi-Res Cribbage</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa was one of the most realistic racing sims up until the early 2000's. It focuses solely on the Ferrari F355 and provides some car set-up options such as cambers, right heights, toe, stabilisers, LSD, and wings. The game was developed by <a href=\"/sega-am2/3010-81/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-81\">Sega-AM2</a>. It was originally released into <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcades</a> in 1999, then in 2000 it was ported to the <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast</a> and in 2002 to the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PS2</a>.</p><p>It was considered the most accurate simulation of the <a title=\"Ferrari F355 (page does not exist)\" href=\"/ferrari-355-f1-coupe/3055-4868/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4868\">Ferrari F355</a> possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time. The realism was further heightened by the sit-in cabinet, with a simulated Ferrari dashboard, force feedback, and three screens increasing the field of vision.</p><h2>Arcade</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90265/1378644-f355_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378644\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.24\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:24.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90265/1378644-f355_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378644\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/90265/1378644-f355_b.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/9/90265/1378644-f355_b.jpg 700w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/90265/1378644-f355_b.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Some versions of the arcade cabinet were noteworthy for having three display monitors allowing the player to look through the side windows as if they were in a real car. The 3-screen cabinet version also featured an H-shaped gear stick and 3 foot pedals. The cabinet itself was comprised of 4 <a href=\"/dreamcast/3045-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">SEGA NAOMI</a> units, 3 of which drove the display monitors, and the other to drive the synchronization between the units.

      "deck": "Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is the most realised iteration of the Speedball franchise. Speedball is a brutal sport where armoured teams face-off in a metal-clad arena with the aim of beating down their rivals and scoring goals for fame and fortune.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.</p><p>Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.</p><p>Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp Gates</p><p>There are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.</p><p>Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.</p><p>Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.</p><p>Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.</p><p>In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.</p><p>In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.</p><p>At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nigel/3005-24746/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24746\">Nigel</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/graham/3005-24748/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24748\">Graham</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/barry/3005-24743/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24743\">Barry</a>. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gaza/3005-24756/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24756\">Gaza</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/roscopp/3005-24761/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24761\">Roscopp</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/jams/3005-24766/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24766\">Jams</a> to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.</p><p>The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.</p><p>Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.</p>",

The game follows either a female (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-5870\" href=\"/pratty/3005-5870/\">Pratty</a>) or male (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-5869\" href=\"/cleru/3005-5869/\">Cleru</a>) protagonist, and their quest to become the Craftlord of Iron, a prestigious title in the in-game world. Swordcraft Story was released on July 26, 2006 in North America (three years after the Japanese release) by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-442\" href=\"/atlus-co-ltd/3010-442/\">Atlus</a> (<a data-ref-id=\"3010-146\" href=\"/banpresto-co-ltd/3010-146/\">Banpresto</a> in Japan), and was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-258\" href=\"/flight-plan/3010-258/\">Flight-Plan</a>.

The game consists of three aspects: smithing weapons, exploring the overworld, or fighting battles.</p><h3>Smithing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2115674-gfs_76664_2_215_mid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2115674\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 540px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"540\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/2115674-gfs_76664_2_215_mid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2115674\"><img alt=\"Browsing crafting techniques for Drills.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/2115674-gfs_76664_2_215_mid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/7465/2115674-gfs_76664_2_215_mid.jpg 540w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/2115674-gfs_76664_2_215_mid.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" data-width=\"540\"></a><figcaption>Browsing crafting techniques for Drills.</figcaption></figure><p>Smithing is the primary focus of the action in Swordcraft Story. There are several variations in weapon crafting, including weapon type and elemental enchantment. There are five different type of weapons that can be crafted: swords, axes, spears, knuckles, and drills. Each of these have their specific advantages and disadvantages. Swords are the \"all-around\" weapon, axes are the power focused weapon, spears are based more on long range hits, knuckles are quick and fast-paced, and drills are automatic, hitting the enemy multiple times while holding down the attack button.</p><p>Weapon enchantments are handled using \"Mystic Ores,\" which can be found scattered throughout the game. Mystic Ores imbue weapons with one of four elements: fire, water, wind, and lightning. This is also dependent on the player's Guardian Beast, whose elemental attributes influence the weapons that the player can craft.</p><p>Other types of accessories can also be equipped that are outside of the crafting process, such as shoes, rings, bracelets, and necklaces. These influence the player's fighting abilities, contributing to a variety of stats.</p><h3>Battling</h3><p>Battling is based on random encounters. When a battle is initiated, the game goes away from the top-down perspective used in the overworld, and switches to a side-scrolling arena. Before a battle, the player has the option to equip up to three weapons (if none are available, the player uses a default hammer in battle), and then four items (consumables, stat-boosting, etc.) or spells (special attacks) can be equipped to the Guardian Beast. During battle, the player can freely switch between their weapons, and freely use the Guardian Beast's attached items and attributes.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/391069-76788_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391069\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 576px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/391069-76788_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391069\"><img alt=\"Battles are side-scrolling, unlike the rest of the game.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391069-76788_2_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391069-76788_2_2.jpg 576w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/391069-76788_2_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\"></a><figcaption>Battles are side-scrolling, unlike the rest of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>There are several statistics that influence a battle, both on the player and the weapon being used. A key part of the battle is a weapon's duration, which goes down each time the weapon is used. If the weapon's duration hits zero during a battle, it breaks and is rendered unusable and cannot be restored. After each battle, all weapon duration is reset, however, so the player simply has to avoid using a weak weapon until the battle comes to a close. Weapon duration can also be increased by using the weapon more, upgrading its TEC statistic.</p><p>The player also has four different statistics that influence the flow of the battle. Attack, defense, agility, and hit points are all a part of this. Attack determines how powerful the player is, defense determines how much damage enemies inflict, agility determines jumping ability and speed, and hit points determine how many hits the player can take.</p><h3>Overworld</h3><p>In the overworld, the player can do a variety of things, including purchasing weapon materials, completing side-quests, progressing the main storyline (which consists of ten different \"days\"), conversing with non-player characters, and exploring the main town of Wystern.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391072\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 576px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391072\"><img alt=\"One of the game's many Guardian Beasts, Sugar.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg 576w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of the game's many Guardian Beasts, Sugar.\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg 576w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/391072-76788_5_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the game's many Guardian Beasts, Sugar.</figcaption></figure><p>The land of Wystern was saved three years ago by Shintetsu, the Craftlord of Iron. But not without a high cost- the Craftlord's own life. Three years later, the other Craftlords began to hold a tournament to determine his replacement. Shintetsu's only child decides to enter the tournament in order to follow in his/her father's footsteps. The gender of the child is determined at the start of the game- the default names are <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5869\" href=\"/cleru/3005-5869/\">Cleru</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5870\" href=\"/pratty/3005-5870/\">Pratty</a>.</p><p>In order to enter the tournament in earnest, the child must acquire a Guardian Beast. There are four to choose from, selected through a small questionnaire a summoner asks the player prior to actually summoning the Beast. Regardless of which one is actually summoned, the Beast is declared the same one used by the player's father.</p><ul><li>Kutty: Plucked from Maetropa, the world of the Phantom Beasts. Doesn't speak English, instead speaking only his name.</li><li>Sugar: Actually named Sugarette, and the princess of Sapureth (the 'spirit world').

Quite shy, and overcompensates with a rude demeanor.</li><li>Zantek: A machine Beast from Loreilal. Despite speaking illegible gibberish, the player character can fully understand what Zantek is saying.</li></ul><p>After summoning the Beast, the player is left to his or her own devices to acquire materials, craft weapons, and win the tournament.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Legend of Kyrandia is a humorous fantasy point and click adventure game developed for home computers by Westwood Studios. It puts the player in the shoes of unlikely hero Brandon, who must uncover his heritage and learn the magic of his family to stop the mad jester Malcolm from destroying the land. Originally released on floppy disks in August 1992, it received an enhanced CD-ROM version with full voice acting in 1993.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>18 years ago the jester Malcolm, a favorite of the Kyrandian court, committed a horrible act of betrayal, killing the king and queen and seizing the Kyragem, the source of all magic of the kingdom. Fearing to confront the power of the gem directly, the royal mystics instead choose to put a barrier around the castle, sealing the mad jester inside.</p><p>This successfully contained the jester, but also denied the mystics access to the Kyragem. Without any way to replenish their magic, the mystics' powers began to wane, and eventually the day came when they could no longer maintain the barrier, and Malcolm broke free.</p><p>Now free to take his revenge, the wicked joker starts with Kallak, the old leader of the mystics, turning him into a living statue - trapped in stone with only his eyes left untouched.</p><p>As Malcolm leaves to wreck havok on the land, Kallak's grandson, Brandon, enters, becoming horrified at what has happened. And if that wasn't enough, he receives a vision from the spirits of land itself revealing that nature itself is dying due to Malcolm's evil magic, and that he has been chosen to stop it - his destiny from before he was born. Startled and confused, Brandon seeks out the help of temple guardian Brynn.</p><p>Also a mystic, Brynn tells Brandon the only way to restore his grandfather is to defeat Malcolm. She offers him an enchanted amulet to aid him, and sends him off to see Darm, the mystics' master of scrolls, and Zanthia the alchemist, to help enhance the amulet's power. As he goes about the tasks they give him, he faces increasing obstruction from Malcolm, but grows even more determined when he learns of his heritage. He is the son of the murdered king and queen, a prince of Kyrandia and the country's rightful ruler.</p><p>Eventually, Brandon becomes ready to face the mad jester, and uses a potion to travel to the now desolate Kyrandian royal castle. Confident in his advantage, Malcolm gives the young prince free rein to wander the keep and witness the victims of his twisted magic. But Brandon manages to provoke him by going after the Kyragem, and then finally tricks him into turning himself to stone. With Malcolm gone, the land is once again safe, and Brandon is free to take his place on the throne as king of Kyrandia.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The Legend of Kyrandia is a classic third person point and click adventure game. It had a very innovative interface, abandoning the list verbs common at the time in favor of the single universal \"use\" cursor seen frequently in modern adventure games. The game also featured a streamlined inventory system, where objects in environment were simply picked up using the cursor and placed in the inventory or used on another object directly, without having to wait for Brandon to be shown walking over to them or performing an action.</p><p>Another unusual aspect is the game's handling consumable items. Rather than restricting the character's use of them, or putting the game in an unwinnable state, it instead simply respawns them, either in a specific place, or randomly across the previously visited locations.</p><p>Kyrandia did however also suffer from some archaic puzzle design, as some of them are very obtuse. They provided little guidance to the player as to what their immediate goal is or how to reach it, and force the player to resort to simple trial an error to get through them.</p><p>Brandon can die if the player performs the wrong action, and places where this can happen are fairly common. Deaths lead to the game being over, and force to player to reload a save game or restart from the beginning. Towards the end, the game can also reach an unwinnable state if Brandon travels to the final location without the required items.</p><p> </p>",

It is slightly adult in its themes with frequent innuendos as well as pop culture references very specific to the early post soviet developments, soviet propaganda about the civil war, and growth of capitalism combined with influx of Western products.</p><p>It is the story of Vasiliy Ivanovich Chapaev (a red commander, a simple manly man, depicted by Soviet era movies about the civil war as the exemplary backbone of the fighting forces) and his lieutenant Petka (Peter) during the Russian Civil war. The story takes place in a small village Gadykino (a play on words in regards to it being a very crappy place to be stuck in as well as a type of snake and in turn a cliche name of a Russian village). They are in a stalemate with the White Guard across the river, with no side wanting to do anything as the conflict has been dragged on for too long. The main heroes wake up from a night of heavy drinking and discover that the banner of the division has been stolen. Their investigative journey takes them from the village to the brothel across the river, followed by a spaceship where they prevent an alien invasion through the power of recycling. Along the way they meet a collection of diverse characters which help drive the story though questionable logic of a point and click adventure as well as great topical humor that is sure to be lost on the younger generations attempting to play it.</p>",

      "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview</h2><p>Gangsters 2 is a Strategy game developed by Hothouse Creations in 2001. It Lets players control a gangster by the name of Joey Bane who is out to revenge his fathers death by killing the mob boss Frankie 'Hammer' Constantine. Throughout each mission the player must assist Joey to 'whack' important mob leaders who were involved in his fathers murder. To do so the player must set up illegal businesses and hire more gangsters and muscle to protect these businesses and in doing so, take over increasing areas of the map. Each gangster hired can have a total of four more muscle assigned to them and the weapons of these muscle can be improved, from pistols up to the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/tommy-gun/3055-261/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-261\">tommy gun</a>. Once Joey has enough support the target can be taken out and the mission is completed. There are also many other ways of controlling the town, through kidnapping, the bribing of officials and bank robbery.</p><p>Although a improvement on the Original Gangsters game it only received mediocre success with critics.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><ul><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">Windows 95/98/Me/XP (Home Edition);</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">Pentium II 266 MHz (Min.), Pentium III (Rec.);</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">4x CD-ROM drive (Min.), 8x CD-ROM (Rec.);</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">64 MB RAM (Min.), 128 MB (Rec.);</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">4 MB DirectX 7 compatible graphics card (Min.), 16 MB (Rec.);</li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\">DirectX 7 compatible sound card.</li></ul><h2>Reception</h2><p>Game Informer gave the review scores of 4 and 5 out of ten.

      "deck": "B-17 Bomber is a flight sim for the Intellivision, in which the player pilots a B-17 aircraft in bombing runs over continental Europe. It is one of only a few games to require the Intellivoice voice synthesis module.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>B-17 Bomber gives players control of a USAAF B-17 stationed in England, and a map full of potential targets in continental Europe. The player then selects one of the targets as a destination, pilots the bomber to the selected target, and attempts to bomb it successfully to earn points.<br/><br/>The Intellivision controller proves very useful in B-17 Bomber, as it uses the number pad layout to allow players to quickly switch between different viewpoints and information screens. In addition, the Intellivoice module gives players distinct voice clips as audio cues during gameplay. Some of these sounds include your bombardier saying, \"Bombs away!\" as bombs are dropped, and other crew members yelling out the direction of enemy fighters; for example, \"Fighters, 3 o'clock!\"<br/><br/><h2>History</h2>Development on B-17 Bomber began in 1981, when <a data-ref-id=\"3040-72615\" href=\"/john-sohl/3040-72615/\" slug=\"john-sohl\">             John Sohl</a> was tasked with creating a game based on one of three concepts that utilized the Intellivoice module. While other programmers worked on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16083\" href=\"/space-spartans/3030-16083/\" slug=\"space-spartans\">         Space Spartans</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1426\" href=\"/bomb-squad/3030-1426/\" slug=\"bomb-squad\">        Bomb Squad</a>, Sohl had the responsibility of making an exciting game based on air traffic controllers. Thankfully, the idea quickly evolved into B-17 Bomber once artist <a data-ref-id=\"3040-97755\" href=\"/bob-del-principe/3040-97755/\" slug=\"bob-del-principe\">            Bob Del Principe</a> suggested turning the plane into a bomber flying over Europe.<br/><br/>By 1982, Sohl created an initial version of the game -- albeit too big for a cartridge and without solid gameplay mechanics. To help with paring and refining the game, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-32234\" href=\"/stephen-roney/3040-32234/\" slug=\"stephen-roney\">           Steve Roney</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-2347\" href=\"/william-c-fisher/3040-2347/\" slug=\"william-c-fisher\">          William Fisher</a> were added to development upon completing Space Spartans. However, the game was still well behind schedule and undeveloped, and many of Mattel Electronic's staff had to participate in the game's development in the final weeks to ensure it shipped on time. On the last day of development, when the game absolutely had to be shipped to the cartridge manufacturers, a random visitor to Mattel was roped into playing the game for thirty minutes, which ended up being the only stint of game testing B-17 Bomber received. With the short test successful, the code was shipped off to manufacturers on April 23, 1982, and released shortly thereafter. <br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>The game starts with the player selecting one of six difficulty levels. The easiest difficulty is a practice level, giving the player 200 bombs to play with and easy enemy defenses. The second level of difficulty starts the player off with an initial payload of 10 bombs, with similarly easy enemy defenses. Each successive difficulty level decreases the initial payload by two bombs and increases the enemy defenses, so the toughest difficulty, level six, gives the player an initial payload of two bombs and extremely tough enemy defenses.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/624214-1056212285_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624214\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/624214-1056212285_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624214\"><img alt=\" Navigation Map of Europe\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/624214-1056212285_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/624214-1056212285_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Navigation Map of Europe</figcaption></figure>     From here, the player is given a map of Europe, including a number of potential targets. Any bombing target can be previewed, which will give a close-up view of the target and the points it is worth. The player then selects a destination, which does not have to be their intended target, and prepares for take-off. The destination can be changed mid-flight. The player can also add bombs to their payload before leaving England, but each additional bomb costs its weight in fuel, meaning the maximum bomb load of 17 (outside of practice) will likely leave the bomber without enough fuel to reach most (if any) targets.<br/><br/>Once the player is ready to take-off, they will accelerate the B-17 to 90 MPH, and take to the air. The cockpit view shows the horizon, with blue or green below the horizon depending on whether the plane is above sea or land. The navigation map can also be brought up to see progress towards the target, or to assign a new destination. This 90 MPH speed is rather important, as falling below it will cause the bomber to stall.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/624220-1056212461_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624220\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/624220-1056212461_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-624220\"><img alt=\" Fighting Enemy Fighters\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/624220-1056212461_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8273/624220-1056212461_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Fighting Enemy Fighters</figcaption></figure>     As the bomber gets further away from England, it will face enemy fighter pilots that will attempt to shoot it down. As these fighters approach, the game will announce both their presence and location; for example, \"Bandits, 9 o'clock!\" The player must switch to the proper gun mount and attempt to shoot the enemy fighters down, or they will damage the B-17. Fighters can also damage the gun ports on the player's bomber, rendering them unusable for the remainder of the flight. Anti-aircraft batteries will also fire flak at the bomber once it is over land, which may damage the B-17 and its bomb targeting sights. The only way to avoid flak is through evasive maneuvers, such as changing air speed, altitude, or banking the plane left or right.<br/><br/>Once the bomber is nearly over its intended target, the player should switch to the bomb bay view, which will give them a top-down view of the ground. The game will notify the player of the target once it appears by saying, \"Target in sight!\" The player then aims the bombsights and attempts to hit the target. This may be especially difficult if anti-aircraft batteries have damaged the bombsights, which will cause the crosshair to disappear.<br/><br/>When the target has been hit, the fuel load is low, or the plane is too damaged to safely continue, the player should turn back to England. The game will automatically land the B-17 when it crosses England's coastline. Returning to England repairs any damage, and allows the pilot to choose a different payload if desired. However, on the next flight, both the enemy fighters and anti-aircraft batteries will be more difficult to contend with.<br/><br/>The game ends when the plane crashes by receiving too much damage, running out of fuel, or pilot error.<br/><br/><h2>Scoring</h2>Players score points by successfully bombing targets, shooting down enemy fighters, and successfully completing missions. Some categories of targets vary in point value, generally based on their importance or distance inland, which make them harder to reach from the England airbase.<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Anti-Aircraft Batteries:</b> 1 point</li><li><b>Airports:</b> 5 points</li><li><b>Factories:</b> 20 to 100 points, depending on distance inland</li><li><b>Ships:</b> 5 to 40 points, depending on size</li><li><b>Enemy Fighters:</b> 2 points each</li><li>Completing a mission earns bonus points</li></ul><br/>Dropping bombs on England results in a <b>heavy</b> score penalty that is typically more than enough to negate any points earned.  <br/> <br/><h2>Links</h2><a href=\"http://www.intellivisiongames.com/bluesky/games/instructions/voice/b17.txt\" rel=\"nofollow \"> Game manual</a> at Intellivision Lives.<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=741_jmeRtv8&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow \"> <br/> Intellivision TV-commercial: B-17 Bomber </a>at Youtube.<br/><a href=\"http://www.gametrailers.com/video/angry-video-screwattack/32245\" rel=\"nofollow \">    AVGN: Double Vision Part 1</a>.

      "deck": "The Earth is now underwater and being attacked by the evil Neptunians! Save all the imprisoned humans with a tricked-out pink submarine.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Sqoon is a video game for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and published by <a href=\"/irem-corp/3010-461/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-461\"> Irem</a> and developed by <a href=\"/home-data-corp/3010-462/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-462\"> Home Data</a>. It is a side scrolling style of game where a pink submarine must defend Earth from the evil aliens of Neptune. At the same time the player must attempt to rescue human survivors and drop them on an island. It had very little adoption in North American and thus was considered a flop. </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Earth is being attacked by the <a href=\"/neptunians/3015-4869/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4869\">Neptunians</a>, an underwater race of alien beings. They do this by melting the polar ice caps, flooding every country across the world. The Neptunians did this because their source of food, man-ham, was depleting due to meteorites turning their world into a desert. So they moved to Earth because of its abundant source of man-ham. </p><p>While all of this was taking place, a pirate named <a href=\"/narikeen/3040-97878/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97878\">Narikeen</a> was mining gold under the oceans of the world using his submarine, named <a href=\"/sqoon/3055-3549/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3549\">SQOON</a>. When his SQOON was full of gold, he would go into port and trade his gold for grog. But when he tried to go to the port, he realized that it was gone. In fact, all the land was gone! </p><p>It was then when he received a message on the radio from the General of the Earth Defense Army warning Narikeen of the Neptunian invasion of the planet Earth. After refusing at first, Narikeen finally agrees to save the trapped humans underwater with his SQOON. He can only carry nine people at a time, transferring them from the underwater base to his motorized floating island. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Sqoon borrows plenty of ideas from <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\">Gradius</a>, and lays out a lot of ground for Irem's big shooter series, <a href=\"/r-type/3025-419/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-419\">R-Type</a>. The game is a classic example of the side-scrolling shooter genre. What separates Sqoon from the rest is its upgrade system, which requires the player release the captured humans, capture nine of them, and successfully stow them away on a motorized floating island in order to upgrade the SQOON's guns. The main gun has two upgrades. The secondary gun is the classic \"below fire\" gun, which is used to break open ocean bottom domes, freeing humans. </p><p>Another unique gameplay feature found in Sqoon is the fuel meter. In order to keep moving forward, the player needs to constantly replenish the fuel meter, which starts out at sixty. Fuel is lost every second. In order to replenish fuel, the player is given a refill of fuel every time they rescue nine prisoners. They can also gain a full refill by killing one of the crabs on the ground, and exchanging what the crab leaves behind on the motorized floating island. Also on the top left, there is a score counter. </p><h2>Upgrades</h2><h3>Starting Weapons: </h3><ul><li>Horizon Missile - Kills the Neptunians</li><li>Ice Ball Gun - Destroys bio hot water factory and enemies. When the ocean bottom dome is broken with the iceball gun, the humans come swimming out. They need to be rescued quickly and transferred to the small motorized island to receive energy for SQOON.</li></ul><h3>Upgraded Weapons: </h3><ul><li>Bow-wow missile - The first power-up, the SQOON's main weapon will be upgraded to the Bob-wow missile. It moves at the same speed as the horizon missile, but it goes through enemies, allowing it to hit any remaining enemies behind it.</li><li>Adenoid missile - If the player has the Bow-wow missile and power-up again, they will receive this weapon. It is the most powerful missile available, giving the SQOON a spread-shot. </li></ul><h2>Worlds</h2><ol><li>Japan</li><li>China</li><li>India</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Hungary</li><li>United States</li><li>Dreamland </li></ol><h2>Enemies</h2><p>All information is from the games' manual:</p><blockquote><p>Sea Slug: Look for it around the cities. It picks up the magic necklace that the mermaid Kazumi has dropped. If you hit it with the ice ball a number of times, it will turn into a necklace. If you pick up this necklace and destroy the bio hot water factory the balance of ocean energy will be disturbed and you may be able to go to some other dimension of the world. This is a magical lifeform.</p><p>Crab: If you shoot it with the ice ball gun, the shell of the crab comes off and you can get the gold inside. Touch the gold to collect it. In a few seconds though, the shell will return and the crab will start walking again. Use your gold well. One gold and one person allows you to refuel from the small motorized island.</p><p>Flounder: This is the Neptunian scout. If you are killed by this, you're not doing very well. The Pirame dance around the screen.</p><p>Ottotto: Baruban (the ruler of the Neptunians) asked someone to create a smart robot, but this is the result. This is a smart robot that needs more brains.</p><p>Turtle: Get away, get away! This turtle is coming! Try to steer clear of this enemy.</p><p>Neptunian Mine: Avoid the mines floating in the ocean. You can destroy them with the ice ball gun.</p><p>Kazumi: Baruban turned Miss Neptune into a mermaid when they reached Earth to confuse the Earth people. However, Kazumi is innocent Miss Neptune. What should you do?</p><p>Snail: It used to be a toy for Yarukisu, the son of Baruban. Don't restrain your attack just because it's a child's toy.</p><p>Spear Shellfish: This is the guard for the Neptunians base. Its thick and hard shell is indestructible, even with horizon missles or ice balls. Avoid them.</p><p>Sunfish: It's the only bio-fish that has a family. It spends all of its time looking for food for the mambouya (little mambo).</p><p>Child Mambo: Don't restrain your attack just because this is a little mambo. It's brave and quick.</p><p>Angler Fish: Look out! This fish swims extremely fast and straight.</p><p>Squid: This creature rushes forward suddenly and then stops when it moves. It doesn't play fair-be careful!</p><p>Flying Fish: JUMP-JUMP-JUMP! If this is around, you can't get close to the surface of the ocean.</p><p>Nautilus Shell: It takes three horizon missiles to kill this enemy. If something is spinning and coming, it must be Paachiki.</p><p>Frog: This amphibian is expressionless because it's actually a statue of a sitting frog.</p><p>Shrimp: It looks strong, but it can be killed with the ice ball gun. It makes good sushi.</p><p>Sea Horse: This is a lost sea horse child, looking for its mother across the oceans.</p><p>Neptunian Ghosts: This is a strange ghost which followed Baruban from the planet Neptune.</p><p>Shellfish: If this sees an enemy, it wants to kill, Look out!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shark/3015-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1466\">Shark</a>: It's the only Earth fish which has been conquered by the Neptunians. It knows that if it follows SQOON, it can get food. It's a man-eating shark.</p></blockquote><h2>Extra</h2><ul><li>Every time the player passes a church, touch a surfer, panda bear, etc., they receive a 1UP.</li><li>Throughout the game's quest, the player travels throughout many major countries in the world, including the USA and China.</li></ul>",

The company's president back in 1981, <a href=\"/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a>, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called <a href=\"/radar-scope/3030-20776/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20776\">Radar Scope</a> (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>.</p><p>The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.</p><p>Donkey Kong was followed-up by <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3030-19416/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19416\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a> , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3005-298/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-298\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a>, who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493144\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493144\"><img alt=\"The Second Level\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Second Level</figcaption></figure><p>Upon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular <a href=\"/popeye/3005-6403/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6403\">Popeye</a> character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular <a href=\"/popeye/3030-14419/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14419\">Popeye arcade game</a>. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, <a href=\"/olive-oyl/3005-7366/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7366\">Olive Oyl</a>, and <a href=\"/bluto/3005-7365/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7365\">Bluto</a>. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Jumpman</a>, who had to save his girlfriend, <a href=\"/pauline/3005-1246/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1246\">Pauline</a>, from the evil gorilla named <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a>. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Gunpei Yokoi</a> who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.</p><p>Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,</p><blockquote><p>\"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands.\"</p></blockquote><p>The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was \"Donkey Kong\". </p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493146\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493146\"><img alt=\"The Final Level\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Final Level\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 512w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Final Level</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about <a href=\"/high-score/3015-260/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high scores</a>, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>.</p><p>As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary <i>King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</i> was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the <a href=\"http://www.billyvssteve.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">official site</a>.</p><p>In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">easter egg</a>, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.</p><h2>Donkey Kong: Original Edition</h2><p>In 2010, a special version of the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> release of Donkey Kong was available to those in <a href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a> who purchased the special <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a> 25th anniversary <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>. This version, subtitled \"Original Edition\", restored the missing \"pie factory\" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.</p><p>This edition of the game would not release in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> or the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> until 2012, and only then, on the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>. In Japan, it was a <a href=\"/pre-order-exclusive/3015-4695/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4695\">pre-order bonus</a> for <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-2/3030-38064/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38064\">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">digital download</a> versions of <a href=\"/art-academy-lessons-for-everyone/3030-38766/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38766\">Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!</a>, <a href=\"/paper-mario-sticker-star/3030-31755/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31755\">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a>, <a href=\"/professor-layton-and-the-miracle-mask/3030-29298/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29298\">Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask</a>, <a href=\"/style-savvy-trendsetters/3030-39284/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39284\">Style Savvy: Trendsetters</a>, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the <a href=\"/colecovision/3045-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-47\">ColecoVision </a>system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later <a href=\"/coleco/3010-302/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-302\">Coleco </a>made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> was also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/01/business/video-games-to-to-hollywood.html\" rel=\"nofollow \">planning </a>to release a version with Coleco.</p><p>Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name \"Crazy Kong\" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3030-19416/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19416\">Donkey Kong Junior</a>, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior.</p><p> </p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun is an RPG developed and published exclusively for the Sega Genesis. It is based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons table-top license, and in particular an obtuse region of the <a href=\"/mystara/3035-4777/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4777\">Mystara</a> campaign setting found inside the planet's hollow core. </p><p>The story begins during the closing onslaught of a goblin siege upon Duke Barrik's castle. In the dying seconds before the castle is overrun, it magically teleports to a new and strange land! In a valley surrounded by sheer cliffs, it falls to a likely band of heroes to venture into the unknown in an attempt to find allies and preserve the kingdom and culture.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game follows the relatively straightforward rules of party system adventuring, with the benefit of the player being allowed to customize their party before the game begins. Like many RPG games, the party members start out as mere weaklings surrounded by superior beasts and enemies. Progression in the early stages of the game demands some time spent on grinding levels and improving inventory items.</p><p>Combat has two modes, depending upon the given situation:</p><ul><li>Out in the open (valley, swamp etc) battles are a strategic affair utilizing a combination of ranged, magic and direct melee attacks. It becomes important here to have a well-rounded party to effectively dispose of enemies. Attacks are based on turns during this combat, for instance, once the party has attacked, the enemy will counter.</li><li>In dungeons/caves the combat moves towards real-time, requiring the player to cycle through attacks using the A or B buttons. Each attack is followed by the next party member, with the ability to actively retreat or pursue enemies should it be necessary.</li></ul><p>In both cases the attack ritual is the same, with a different attacks mapped to both A and B.</p><h2>Visual Style</h2><p>In normal adventuring mode, 70% of the screen shows the party in the world from a distorted isometric viewpoint. The other 30% of the screen shows status bars and pictures of each member of the party including which attacks are mapped to A and B buttons.</p><p>During underground adventuring in dungeons/caves, the screen changes to include a notepad section that describes traps, smells, approaching enemies and items found. This effectively limits the viewport down to about 25% of the screen which displays a 3D dungeon/cave.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Cleric</h3><p>Proficient in both spell casting and fighting. Many of their spells heal damage or negate adverse effects on party members.</p><h3>Fighter</h3><p>The primary warriors of any party. They generally have the most hit points and deal the most damage. Fighters are great leaders to a party as they can absorb lots of damage, effectively protecting the other members.</p><h3>Magic-User</h3><p>Spellcasters who have the lowest hit points yet can cause tremendous damage from range. Magic-Users also have the ability to 'entangle' enemies effectively paralyzing them so they become vulnerable to melee attacks.</p><h3>Thief</h3><p>Specializing in stealth, sneaking up on opponents and removing traps. Thieves are good in battle using ranged weapons such as bows and slingshots.</p><h3>Dwarf</h3><p>A shorter, stockier version of the Fighter. Dwarves receive as many hit points as Fighters and are just as good at dealing out damage.</p><h3>Elf</h3><p>Combining the skills of fighting and magic, elves are a good all rounder to any party. They are neither as strong as Fighters, or as powerful as Magic-Users however.</p><h3>Halfling</h3><p>An interesting combination of Fighter, Cleric and Thief, the Halflings can handle their own in a battle yet don't have the highest hit points, and they can also hide like a thief without some of the trap spotting abilities.</p><p>Each character class can be male or female with the added ability to customize color, name and beginning stats.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p>When released Electronics Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 4,7,4,7 adding, \"...exceptional graphics for this type of game. If you are into RPGs give this one a try you won't be disappointed\".</p>",
